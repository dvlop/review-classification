-   Good Phone for this price bracket but the screen is very fragile i dropped a 5 rupee coin on the screen accidentally and the whole display is cracked so if u buy this pls handle it with care and also there is no notification LED for missed calls and sms alerts.very very fragile display
-   Friends listen carefully I had bought this cell day before yesterday and today morning I returned.Reason I found the rear camera pathetic specially in dark or night pix...As compare to this 13MP camera Grand 2 8MP is much clear n better. So my suggestion pls don't buy this at all..
-   Fast delivery and excellent packaging from seller/Amazon. Plastic quality is satisfactory. Good for storing food stuff in freezer. Not leak proof but somewhat airtight. Even ideal for reheating in Microwave.
-   I have ordered an item with orange colour ( i.e as per display but they supplied a dark blue item. It is a worst product and no use of it. Do not purchase it.The shapes of the containers shown in the picture is square where as I received round containers. VERY BAD. Products don't match the photograph or the description at all. Fell much below my expectations. Quality of plastic is substandard. The finishes are not good . edges are not smooth and the lid doesn't fit the box easily
-   awesome deal with awesome quality plastic containers.look worthy deal
-   Good Quality, I like it, though you can't judge size from the picture. I think dimensions for all products should be mentioned while selling online.
-   Bought this for Rs. 529. Good utility product. The price could be more appealing. But anyways. A good product. Can be ised for storing sifferwnt things in the refrigerator. It can apso be used as a tiffin box for kids. And storing abstract things like vuttons, medicines etc..
-   Quality of plastic is poor, something not expected from the house of Princeware, otherwise the item is okay. Incidentally, I had purchased the same item sometime back from local market and was impressed with its quality, hence I ventured to buy it online.
-   I ordered an orange set, instead I received a blue set. This caused disappointment, particularly because I already have a blue set. I wanted a different colour for easy identification and coding. The invoice reads Orange but what I received was blue.
-   It's clearly mentioned that that the color of the product is ORANGE where as I received BLUE products. The shapes of the containers shown in the picture is square where as I received round containers. VERY BAD. Products don't match the photograph or the description at all.
-   just received my set. I have bought it from Solmarc Corporation at such an amazing price of just Rs.371. Very nice packaging and i loved the colour. Solmarc Corporation please launch some more products at these amazing prices. Can't wait.
-   Nice package. Quality of the product is good. I ordered 2 sets and they delivered both in same color as required.Delivered the product 7 days earlier as promised by AMAZON.
-   It wasn't the expected product. It was too small to use and its blue colour not orange, any way that's not a big deal.But it wasn't useless for us. As usual Amazon great packing.
-   The box sizes are too small to use. The product doesn't worth Rs. 215/- and is available at much cheaper rate in market and D-mart. I never recommend this product.
-   Very Low Quality, Didnot Match Photgraph /Description At All Package Contents "Mention "Airtight storage Containers"But Is Normal Container "
-   Good packaging and delivery by amazon. containers were of superior quality and leak proof. I got it as a lightning deal for Rs.215 only which was really good.
-   These things are really good. I got it in offer price. It's worth the money. Really far better quality than I expected in this price range. Thank you Amazon
-   if you have no storage provision then you can buy this otherwise wastage of money. too much small and its numbers are very large so not useful someway.
-   not satisfied with product....I bought it for.295 but quality of product is not good...we can get such kind of product in low price in local market
-   it could be better in terms of its quality. despite of several negative reviews i have ordered this item but its not expected by priceware.
-   Nice product at affordable price .product quality is good ..though some container r too small I have found where to utilise them so m happy
-   Average product, plastic quality is not great, but manageable, there are more of the small containers, should have been a better mix
-   small only r for use but for other utility it is gud 4 containers we can use for fridge purpose other containers are 2 small
-   Value for money for quick storage of items, as i got it in a deal for half the price. You can get a better quality but then be prepared to pay that much more. I would not but it at full price though.
-   The title is incorrect for this product on Amazon. The product is precisely "Tenda 150 Mbps MINI Wireless USB Adapter".It is not Nano, but yes it is very tiny, plugs to the USB with only the black chip protruding out. Like the description says, its almost invisible.Fully compatible with RPi2, with OPENELEC Kodi, pure plug and play. It has a pretty decent range coverage.This is absolute must have for RPi. Install Yatse from Google Play and control everything wireless on your RPi
-   After using it for a few days realized its an extremely pathetic product. Doesn't catches signal even when you are 3-4 meters away from the router. Even when it catches signal it is accompanied with frequent signal drops. It connects at 5-9 mbps even when my ISP provides signal at 12 mbps. I wish I could now return the product at get my money back as even 200/- seems too high for this s***ty product. Finally, I would not recommend it even if they put it at Re.1 in lightening deals.
-   This does not fit in a USB slot. You have to push it forcefully. After a few forceful removals from my computer I was afraid it will damage the slot. The makers have not sized the device USB connector correctly.
-   Works really well with my win 7 desktop, speed is really fast
-   Exclent product full bar in 10 meter range,no net drop cheap price also work in window 7,8 a must buy product Tenda W311mi 150mbps.
-   good product in low price, it can connect well in higher speed than other brands, even from far place. I tried it on a CPU from first floor while the router is placed at ground floor, the speed of data transfer is pretty good than expected.
-   Works great. I am very happy that I got this in very low price
-   Good product. Works like a charm. Comes with a CD which you will need to install before you can use the product. Just make sure that when you first install the CD, you plug in the device in the USB port which you plan to use continuously because if you want to change the port later on you'll have to reinstall the CD.
-   Wasted 6 mins of my life ordering it, wasted 30 mins of my life trying to figure out how to set up the damn thing to create a hotspot for my phone from a net cafe
-   Small and simple to connect. Works fine and speed is good.
-   Had used it to connect my office desktop. For this price I would say look no further.
-   Good product. But I found an issue with windows 7. It is not detecting when system switched on. We have to remove and reinsert to get it work. This issue is not always, but sometimes.
-   hardware not strong , when user plug this pen drive many times its damage and out from warranty. so company give 5 year
-   Good service from amazon, and product is also good. Value for money product for any day and using it satisfactorily.
-   Nice and cute. Worth buying. My daughter liked it most.
-   Misleading information, bad customer service. As per Epson customer service, this is a document printer and you should not use it to print in photo or any glossy paper beyond 90 gsm. This is ridiculous, this information is not given anywhere on Epson portal.It has frequent paper feeding problem, and customer service says it is because you are using glossy paper and service will be chargable.If you are looking for real all-in-on printer, don't go for it. You will be disappointed since it can not print on glossy or photo paper. Maximum GSM supported is 90 gsm.
-   If you are looking for real all-in-on printer, don't go for it. You will be disappointed since it can not print on glossy or photo paper. Maximum GSM supported is 90 gsm.
-   An excellent printer for home use when you need to print multiple colour pages for your kids scrapbook and projects. Epson's Ink Tank feature helps it to stand out from HP and Canon. Printing is fast (after the ink is charged) and also good in quality. I fired a photograph print on regular A4 sheet and was amazed by the details of colour printed.
-   Its an perfect printer with this price tag. Serves similarly as mentioned on product, fast, quality and jam free. Only problem is it takes a pause for a while when print/copy load is very large, but can be neglected. Must buy for home use.
-   its good one for day to day printing purpose who want to take prints b/w and color also its very easy to install and to run and its also easy to fill the ink in ink tanks and the print quality is excellent in b/w and in color it is moderate not up to he mark of laser but still it is very good quality in color print also it is worth to buy this printer thanks for amazon delivering very fast and safe this is review is on the base of one month use i will give another review on further use
-   M using this printer from last 2-3 months , fully satisfied with the performance ... Product is fully genuine n I have registered the same online with Epson also. I have already printed almost 200 coloured pages n no decrease in ink level ...
-   The machine built is good and the ink-tank system is excellent resulting in less ink consumption, low maintenance & ease of handling. The print quality compared to other inkjet printers is poor. The printing cost per page is very cheap and maintenance is less cumbersome compared to other inkjet machines. Given its high price, only buy it if you have bulk printing requirements.
-   Colour prints from this printer is very faint. I thought the tank technology would enhance colour printing but very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend it.
-   As per service team of epson ,This cannot be used for 130 GSM or more and it can be used for normal paper I.e75 GSM only But if go to company website it show that you can use Epson high glossy paper.So by the statement of service manager company has give wrong statement on their website..So plz check paper size before buying this printer.
-   got for 149. superb buy. very less scratches as compared to other pearlpet bottles. my fridge looks cool with the bottles especially with the color of the bottles. just buy them if u get it for 150 or below. They are classy and also very cosy to sip coz it has narrow mouth.
-   Received two sets of these water bottles in a very good condition, packaging was well and good. And bottles were neat too, thats the thing i like it about amazon, amazon guys just package it the best way they can, I'm completely satisfied with the service, and bottles were fine, no smell or that plastic kinda feel, feels pretty solid. Go for it, keep it in fridge, car or home wherever you like these are pretty stable and size is standard.
-   Bought it for my refrigerator usage. Delivered perfectly and before time. Well packed and cl
-   I am a regualar customer of amazon for last 5 years ..this is perhaps the worst product i have received so far..water bottles leaking from the brim ..dont buy this one...
-   The bottles are OK for storing drinking water and should be replaced with a new one as soon as it starts showing signs of ageing.
-   Poor quality. One of the bottle has already bent , within one day of use.
-   Product delivery was delayed by 3-4 days. Product is ok ok as it is not as tough as expected from princeware.
-   The pet bottles recived by me is in good.The picking is also good. But the quality of material is very fair. The plastic materials used for thos bottle is not in good quality. Better quality bottles available in the open market for the same rate.
-   great look,good finish and anti slip design.material is a bit thin,however at this price range its a lot better than other brands.
-   Loved the much waited product, delivered after 14 days. New design, Small size cap bottles good for a change. Priceworthy.
-   The material isn't too tough. However, I think the quality of the bottles was worth the cost spent.
-   The image is deceptive. Suggest you to change it. Adapter is also shown in the product image which was not shipped with the memory card. However since the product details din mention it too i didnt bother to return it as the effort is not worth the price (170/-) paid for the memory card. However i bought it for the sole reason of adapter and was disappointed not to find it.
-   Hello I ordered this from amazon.in and it was delivered on Monday 19 May 2014. but after 2 months it stop working and i tried to connect in different mobile phones and as well as card reader but it is not detecting. i have almost lost all my personal data like images video and other data as well. kindly let us know from where i can get this replace?
-   I have gifted it to my sister for her mobile phone, but it stopped working almost after 10days. Really disappointed with this purchase, wont recommend to anybody.
-   I feel I've been befooled. I received the product with a slit in the inner protective package. To my utter shock and surprise I found that the product was missing inside it. The TRANSCEND packet was already tampered and torn and the memory card was not there. I still simply can't believe it has really happened to me. Please redress the issue and take prompt action. I look forward to your justice.
-   I brought this almost a year ago and still its going great.. Never had any issues... I brought it for my Samsung smartphone and now using it on my Lumia.. Everytime it has worked awesome with reasonable data transfer speed.. I have songs videos pictures and never my data got corrupted nor had any issue retrieving my data.. Package and delivery was also on time and secure.. Sure go for it
-   It works so far so good.Don't have any complain against it.My phone supports upto 32gb expendable memory so i bought it,& by compairing this is the cheapest by any other micro memory cards available in online store.Amazon provides this card on a suitable price,althogh they delayed by giving this product.I got it after 2dayz of said date.
-   I bought this card through amazon 15 days before. Till now no problem' superb card for the price. Best friend for my smartphone.I always prefer amazon over other online sites because of their competetive pricing and highly professional behaviour. As usual delivery was before the commited time and packaging was mind blowing.
-   I have always used SanDisk and HP brand even for thumb drive but because of the slight discount, I chose Transcend this time. The micro sd card in my phone was loosing space and used this Transcend 16 GB for replacement and is working quite well. I had it formatted in my HTC phone itself before use and works like a breeze.
-   Mere a week after purchase, this card got damaged and found unreadable on any PC, Laptop (through card reader and data cable as well), Mobile, Tablet, when i tried to return it, the returnable date got expire. Then immediately i went to a shop nearby and purchased another one. I am Very Very disappointed with the quality.
-   I recently got this memory card from Amazon.com and the delivery was exceptional as it reached me before delivery time.Thanks.I opened the sealed pack and came to know its a genuine stuff handed to me.Thanks.i m already using this memory card and its quite responsive and fast.Thanks to Amazon team again.
-   Very promt service at reasonable rates. I will more purchase in future. I am satisfied with Amazon. Thank you very much
-   The memory card received from amozon in short time. The packing is very good. Comparing other online sites the prices of the certain products is very less.
-   It worked for 2 days after once I removed and inserted It's not working and not detecting by System or My Dell Tab. Very worst product. Loss of money and time. Amazon cheating people by encouraging this kind of products. I lost reliability and I won't purchase on Amazon.
-   your dispech and delavary time very slow and large.your service is very poor . home shop18 and snepdeal.naaptol.-very fast.So please improve your service quality and make call by sellar when hand over item.
-   This is a worst product and its life is only 2 moths, I used it for 2 months and not it is corrupted and not working, Please don't by memory card from Ankita Infosys & from Amazon. It is a bad experience and I will never by it from amazon
-   five star for amazon packing & fast delivery, 4 star for product, its memory card, which i used for two months then got corrupt or crashed, or something else, dont know whats happen but now its dead and not working, i lost my data
-   The product which one is received by me is to some extent different from that on description. On image it was a memory card along with a adaptor but actually i had received a memory card on packet but does not have any adaptor
-   My memory card is not working properly... Whatever i dwnld it goes in phone memory not in memory card.. Even i had chnged storage settng frm phone memory to sd card.. Plz ry me wat i should do..asap..
-   memory card received from amozon in short time. The packing is very good. Comparing other online sites the prices of the certain products is very less.
-   Transcent 8GB Microsd card is really good .. It gave me 800kb/ps copying speed on my card reader .. Files load and plays photos and videos fast in any mobile . good for average use and has a long life span. delivery was a bit slow . it is totally worth it for it's price tag
-   It appears utmost care is taken for packing this product. I appreciate Amazon.in in this regard. Comparatively, the product is delivered at the lowest price among all e-portals. Since, it is (8GB) "memory card", generally such products are good in performance.
-   Excellent - Very good product & at a discounted rate. worth going in for such products but need to be careful what u choose on the website. Always use the latest version like class 4 & not class 10.
-   I am already using a F&D Home theater 7.1 which was converted to 8.1. That is the reason I purchased the same from you. In Fact I personally know the regional head of F&D in Bangalore and could have got the same at a much lower price. But......
-   Very very poor...service because this items use only 10 to 15 days.....after these days memory card not runing. I think this is not original product..so take care for amazon service....
-   I have purchased this and started to use this memory card. after 3 days it starts giving me problem as a message comes on my mobile screen as "SD CARD REMOVED UNEXPECTADLY".
-   It was my first purchase at amazon and I was very disappointed about this product bcz I had purchased my new I phone and the SD card was not working so returned the very same day.
-   Product is good, but the image is misleading. Was expecting the adapter along with the card, but to my disappointment it was not there. The product image should be changed.
-   I bought Hypernation womens cotton long sleeve top. Its worthless of money because you may buy the same product at cheaper cost from your local market. Nothing is special.
-   It was 8 gb memory card, but the usable part was only around 1 gb and then it was not catching any other file in it. So it was useless and I have returned the same back.
-   By looking at the image I thought this will come along with the adapter. But there is no adapter. So this product did not meet my expectations and I have to return this.
-   Nice memory card easy to set up in any mobile. I recommend to all my friends and buyers on online shoping. It is very low cost when compared to outlet shop near by me. amazon servicing is great nicely packed received with out any damage.
-   Memory card is working very good.Delivery of memory card through to me very fast.I like no shipping costs on this product.yours dedication on custmer are good.And also your website working and very helpfully to customers.thank you
-   There is no doubt about a product from transcend. The memory card is awesome. The speed is 6-7 mega bytes which is quite nice. Also thanks to Amazon.in as it provided the product at the lowest price in the market and quite quickly too.
-   The product is fine.. got it at one of the best market prices. However since it was pre-paid the delivery got a bit delayed. However there was a proper tracking facility available. So all in all a good product and good service.
-   Amazing product..Great packing..Original Product.....Same product received as in the picture....Prices are affordable... Card is working smoothly without any problems....Delivery of product was earlier than expected date
-   The memory card received from amozon in short time. The packing is very good. Comparing other online sites the prices of the certain products is very less but 16gb memory card in 14.3gb is on space what is this....?
-   Good. As expected. It has been almost 2 months now. it looks to be fine without any problem.The best fact is AMAZON makes me feel that its much more better than any other online shopping sites.
-   It was a Quick Delivery as I ordered on 7th Dec, the product arrived on 11th Dec. It gave 7.42GB in drive out of 8GB. The product price is also quite cheap for 8GB. Its worth it. Thanks Amazon for the product
-   i would like to bring to your notice that despite 3 complaints reguarding my package as undeliverd to right address or to someone else.kindly look into the matter
-   This was supposed to be card with adapter. But guess what ... i got only micro sd 4gb card !.photo description does not match with what was shipped. Be careful
-   Only one month usages after my card was not working.... Did not take an actions... And without replacements. Not responding for customer care... Totally waste...
-   this is memory card is 16 GB is variable but actual 14.8GB is available in memory card so please exchange this my memory card / always full refund my money.....
-   this memory card do not work properly.and this memory card is very slow working.try another sandisk memory card or I think try another transed memory card.
-   your product not satisfy me sir, because with in 1 week its showing memorycard unmounted, poor product sir, if u can help me please resend other memory card
-   Only one month usages after my card was not working.... Did not take an actions... And without replacements. Not responding for customer care... Totally waste...
-   I order a memory card and next day i got it. Itś so fast service that i am happy fot it and product also ossom in these price but overall i like his packing. The way they are packing really impressive. Thanks
-   Awesome memory card... writing this review with this memory card in my cell.... works amazingly without any faults in my Samsung galaxy grand prime..... no faults or loss of data till now!! awesome price!!
-   Go for it, doesn't matter, weather a class 4 or class 10, but no argument with a speed concerned. if anybody who oftenly removes and stores musicc, than thoase guys better go for class 10 else this fine.
-   Good Product Thank You To The Seller & Amazon... All Products Easily Can Get Through (COD) Cash On Delivery.... Transcend Memory Card Micro SD No Need To Be Worried About It Just Buy It And Use..........
-   This is a great memory card and I got it for an amazing price of 219 rs. Thank you very much amazon. I didn't expect to receive a memory card adapter, but I received it , this was outstanding. Thank you.
-   Don't believe that Class 4 memory cards are not good in copying files, but myself I had used this memory card and It is really fast in Copying Files From the Computer to the Memory Card. So, Go for this.
-   Transfer speed is good enough for audio files. Price is good too. Go for it if you are planning to use it for audio streaming.If you intend to use it for movie streaming, go for a higher class.
-   The product was exactly as per the specification and the price was the cheapest compared to all other websites... Though it was not delivered on time but the quality of product made up for the delay.
-   it was not working after 5 days...it cause me lot of discomfort. and you just returned my money rudely instead of replacing the product.
-   Huh! Its not even been 10 days the memory card stopped working. This is the worst product you can ever buy. These people are just scam.
-   I have to format the memory card frequently as it becomes unusable and it asks to format the card every now and then as it is corrupted
-   Good. Card will not be covered fully after insertion. About one third of the card will be outside of the reader. It was not expected.
-   It was faulty product which was delivered to me. I formatted it more then five time with different tools not its working fine.
-   This product very bad. Don't take this product. After some time the stored video gets currupted. * DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT *
-   Got the invite for participating in the Amazon blockbuster weekend. Made full use and ordered as soon as the invite ordered. Whats not to like about the phone. Excellent.
-   This is a beautiful product, flaws and all. Yes the lack of NFC, Quick Charge, or even the absurd(!) QHD/2K display might sound a huge let down. But the very fact that this phone is being compared to the flagships* of other companies and gaining a respectable ranking compared the top dogs in current market is by itself a great achievement.
-   After more than a month of waiting it was time to get the beast home. I got it yesterday. The phone came in an amazing condition, very well packaged and the same day. Hats off to the Amazon Delivery Team.Now about the phone. The OS is buttery smooth. The finger print scanner is mind bogglingly fast. The 4GB RAM and the Snapdragon 810 is going to blow you off your feet. No heating issues as of now. Yes, the One Plus team has managed to fix this notorious chipset known for its core heating. It works beautifully. The camera quality both front and back are pretty good maybe not iPhone standard but definetely one of the best camera's out there. Oxygen OS is as close as stock android gets. I'm a fan of stock android and I don't like custom OS's or unnecessary bloatware. The 'shelf' feature is something I could get used to. It's nice. One Plus has tweaked the OS in the right ways provide you the complete One Plus experience for example there is the 'dark mode' that is easier on the eyes. Plus I never really liked the White background of the app drawer. So yes. I am a fan. I could forego the unavailability of NFC. Not much of a Google wallet user. But the quick charge could have been accommodated but then again if it was we all know how much time world likes complaining about heating phones and then blame it on the company. This phone may not be a flagship killer of 2016 or even 2015. But this phone is the best that 25000 bucks can buy. ASUS does offer the Zenfone 2. 4GB RAM and near same specs but I'm not a fan of the bugs and the customised OS. I hope I helped.
-   I received one plus two mobile phone the next day I placed order. Thanks to Amazon team. The phone is sleek, smooth and awesome. Features of phone are great and functioning well. Camera picture quality is good. Phone is worth buying.
-   Loving the phone. There are frequent updates for the OS which are making it better. Snapdragon 810 is a chipset which runs warm not HOT as others claim. The camera quality is also superb. The audio output via speakers is a bit on the low side but the output via the headphone jack is superb. The phone feels light and ergonomic, plus the sandstone back is awesome.I would recommend this phone to anyone who has the budget and an invite (ofcourse) to buy one. This is one phone which gets close to Samsung galaxy s6 and iphone 6 in true sense and almost at the half of their price.
-   One plus 2 is really a very nice device.The Snapdrago 810 processor, featuring 4G LTE and an octa-core CPU, effortlessly powers through demanding apps, games, and HD video. Paired with a 3,300 mAh battery, your OnePlus 2 will stay charged through even the busiest of days. The phone has awesome look. This phone is the best phone my friends. I am really happy with OnePlus 2 .
-   Am a big fan of one plus team !! But this product really weird to use !! Metal frame heating like anything even though using normal browsing and WhatsApp ususge !! When I was contacted one plus support team, they were saying sir 810 SD Processor should get heat and also suggested me to remove all 3rd party apps , I have removed still the same !! So don't buy this phone wait for next release at end of this year !!
-   Heating issues. Got heated to 40 degrees with just 15 mins of usage. Plus it also lagged a lot. Surprising my Nexus 5 was much smooth
-   The 2 days old phone stopped working after the OTA update provided by one plus. Customer care sucks...asking me to return it thru Amazon instead of a solution
-   Disappointed with the OP2. Being an OPO owner, had high hopes which crashed like a beta app. The screen looks faded out & colour reproduction is poor. The phone heats quite substantially during charging or CPU intensive use. However i loved the camera. It produces sharp images & focuses fast. Battery life is decent. Got like 4hrs of SOT with 3G always on, auto-sync always on. Returned the phone after all the Invite fiasco.
-   Within 15 minutes of normal use, the phone became hot as hell. The heating effect was quite consistent when used over wifi/3G/call. Although everything else was fine, I decided to return it.
-   Its not been even two weeks.... the hardware stopped working properly.... Even service center don't have spare parts available. they replaced my screen with someone else screen... which was also not working properly....... this is such a bad behavior of the OnePlus two service..... It will take more than 3 weeks minimum for them to repair a small issue..... Really pissed of with this... i hope i had cancelled this order & gone for some branded stuff.
-   Average phone.... Gets heated up very soon.... Weight is more... Noise clearance fr call is nt good... Battery discharges very soon... Over an average phone... And not worthy
-   The sound is great. But I feel the sides should have been slightly bigger to cover the entire ear for more comfort. It gets a little uncomfortable after listening for a while as I feel the press pressure on my ear.
-   The build quality is average. Sound is good wirh clear bass. Been using it for 4 months. No issues yet. At this price its a good deal.
-   I have received this product on yesterday i have got awesome experience of bass in the headphone, good at bass levels but trebles are very poor and loudness too. totally good sound at this price. bass is awesome guys.
-   First of all the brand says it all.....sound quality is too gud....very comfortable to wear....If you are looking for the best headphones under 1k these are best!..
-   Absolutely love it. I got it for Rs.600 in some deal and I have been using them from over a year. These headphones are really awesome and one of my favorite things I possess. The only drawback is that the outside of your ear might start paining a bit after 2-3 hours of continuous use. But I have got so used to them, I keep them with me always. Also, the bass is great giving you the full feel of the beats.I got them for Rs.600 in some deal, if you are getting them even for any price less than Rs.800 to Rs.900, GO FOR IT!
-   This is a too good product @ Rs 599. Sound is very good,clarity,vocals are good. And now comes the most important thing about this- BASS. The depth of the bass is more as compared to Sony xb450. The only bugs of this product is,you can not wear it constantly for 1hour. For the bass and sound quality it really worth a 5 star. i am giving 4 star for the build quality and comfort. For bass heavy music listeners,just one word---- Just go for it and you are gonna find deeply in love with it.... Awesome sound and again BASS-JBL.
-   I bought it for 600 on amazon daily deals. For this price the sound quality, bass and clarity is impressive. It is quite light weight and look good.This is an on the ear headphone. Donot get confused as the earbuds give an impression of it being as over the ear.On the downside you absolutely CANNOT wear it for more than an hour or two after which your ear lobes will hurt.Verdict: Low price, good quality, light weight but not for prolonged use.
-   JBL the name itself have a high brand value which attracts me for buying this headphone at low price. But after getting the product I am happy with the OutPut its produced but I am equally disappointed with its design aspects. I am using headphone for at least 3-4 hours everyday but its design of ear pad is so bad that it harts ear after using 30-45 mins. It should be such a size that the entire ear fits into the hole and the pressure should be in the head part not in the ear.
-   I ve been looking for this one for a long time and then I bought it for 799 INR..thought twas quite a steal...got it within three days..thanks amazon..Coming to this JBL ...its quite underwhelming...it s actually smaller than it looks in here...but the build is quite sturdy..can withstand some manhandling....I can't wear it for more than half an hour continuously as my earlobes tend to ache a lot..coming to the sound..I'm not a bass head..but this JBL has much bass and not so clear treble..the chord and jack is quite good but i m not happy with the sound that's it...its jus disappointing me as this is my first JBL..FINAL VERDICT..it s worth jus a 500 bucks maybe..(actually I loved my Philips SHL 3000 ..guys looking for a nice balanced output and a very light weight headphone which can withstand so much..I ve really manhandled the Philips so much..literally threw it against the wall but if jus won't give up haha..and I got it for jus 580..dude its jus a suggestion).
-   Don't expect much from this headphone. It's less than 1k and it gives the output based on that. If you need bass, please go for any other brand like Sony( considering the 1k budget, else u could choose high end model in JBL itself). In terms of comfort, it's horrible. I could feel the heat just after listening songs for 10 minutes and u feel the sweat in your ears. If you need an headset with decent sound clarity you can choose this, forgetting about bass. If you can afford another 500 bucks, you can go for sony mdr xb 400.
-   I found the headphone quite bulky and cumbersome to carry around (Ya, I know its a headphone..What was I thinking?). But honestly, if you are thinking of purchasing this for listening to music on your commute I suggest you don't (unless you are okay with it hanging around your neck). Moreover it starts getting a little uncomfortable after about 20-30 mins and you will find the need to constantly adjust it to relieve the pressure. The sound quality is decent when it comes to any of the normal phones or music players - not much bass and lots of background noise seeps in. The volume at max too seemed a little low in my opinion. However, I was more than surprised when I plugged this into my iPhone - the sound was miles better than with my Sony Xperia. The bass was good and background sounds too were minimized (perhaps I am just judging it against the sound quality with the Sony). Overall this is a decent headphone at the given price.
-   Actually my brother is using Philips Shl3000rd model headset.. I scolded him y u bought this Philips brand wen jbl cmng for the same price.. Again I ordered jbl as it was great brand for audio devices.. Compared to looks jbl is great.. But cmng to the sound quality it is very cheap and comfort is very bad within 10 mins u will get pain as those are very tight.. Now Philips is looking great for me I suggest everyone to buy philips then jbl..
-   returned the product because of low volume. never by if you love loud music , also music is not audible clearly even in indoors
-   Ear lobes pain. Sound quality not to the mark. Need to adjust equaliser settings to obtain bearable sound quality.
-   The sound quality is just about average. There is very little Base & the Treble setting is very low. The inbuilt sound setting in the headphones cannot be even by altering the Equalizer setting in your Laptop, Phone, Mp3 Player, etc.But for the price of Rs. 899, its a good buy. I recommend it for non enthusiasts. I have kept it as my back-up headphones.
-   well this headphone's are horrible. They are not up to the standard did not like the sound quality at all,
-   This may look really good and comfortable, but after using it for a 90 min movie your ears will start hurting. Sound quality is definitely not as good as described or expected from a (2500/- MRP) JBL product.That's why so called 'Sale' looks quite fake. It's hardly worth 500/- that too for its looks.QUITE DISAPPOINTING.
-   Worth the price, but not a very good pair of headphones. You definitely get good bass but voice clarity is not up to the mark. But what more can I ask for a meager 600 Rs!! 3 stars just for the price. Overall, buy it if it's available for 600 Rs or less, paying anything more would be a waste of your money.
-   Got the delivery in less than 48 hrs of order. Truly Amazon wins all corners from snapdeal, flipkart in their delivery which has gained extreme confidence in ordering from Amazon.Packing was superb in a box. About the product was genuine and satisfies the hearing as using it on my Xiomi M4 and TV for playing PS3. Main motive not to disturb my wife while I play and it fulfills my needs. Got the Jbl at Rs 499 so in such price this is great.FX AUDIO keep up the good work. Thanks
