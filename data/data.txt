-   Good Phone for this price bracket but the screen is very fragile i dropped a 5 rupee coin on the screen accidentally and the whole display is cracked so if u buy this pls handle it with care and also there is no notification LED for missed calls and sms alerts.very very fragile display
-   Friends listen carefully I had bought this cell day before yesterday and today morning I returned.Reason I found the rear camera pathetic specially in dark or night pix...As compare to this 13MP camera Grand 2 8MP is much clear n better. So my suggestion pls don't buy this at all..
-   Fast delivery and excellent packaging from seller/Amazon. Plastic quality is satisfactory. Good for storing food stuff in freezer. Not leak proof but somewhat airtight. Even ideal for reheating in Microwave.
-   I have ordered an item with orange colour ( i.e as per display but they supplied a dark blue item. It is a worst product and no use of it. Do not purchase it.The shapes of the containers shown in the picture is square where as I received round containers. VERY BAD. Products don't match the photograph or the description at all. Fell much below my expectations. Quality of plastic is substandard. The finishes are not good . edges are not smooth and the lid doesn't fit the box easily
-   awesome deal with awesome quality plastic containers.look worthy deal
-   Good Quality, I like it, though you can't judge size from the picture. I think dimensions for all products should be mentioned while selling online.
-   Bought this for Rs. 529. Good utility product. The price could be more appealing. But anyways. A good product. Can be ised for storing sifferwnt things in the refrigerator. It can apso be used as a tiffin box for kids. And storing abstract things like vuttons, medicines etc..
-   Quality of plastic is poor, something not expected from the house of Princeware, otherwise the item is okay. Incidentally, I had purchased the same item sometime back from local market and was impressed with its quality, hence I ventured to buy it online.
-   I ordered an orange set, instead I received a blue set. This caused disappointment, particularly because I already have a blue set. I wanted a different colour for easy identification and coding. The invoice reads Orange but what I received was blue.
-   It's clearly mentioned that that the color of the product is ORANGE where as I received BLUE products. The shapes of the containers shown in the picture is square where as I received round containers. VERY BAD. Products don't match the photograph or the description at all.
-   just received my set. I have bought it from Solmarc Corporation at such an amazing price of just Rs.371. Very nice packaging and i loved the colour. Solmarc Corporation please launch some more products at these amazing prices. Can't wait.
-   Nice package. Quality of the product is good. I ordered 2 sets and they delivered both in same color as required.Delivered the product 7 days earlier as promised by AMAZON.
-   It wasn't the expected product. It was too small to use and its blue colour not orange, any way that's not a big deal.But it wasn't useless for us. As usual Amazon great packing.
-   The box sizes are too small to use. The product doesn't worth Rs. 215/- and is available at much cheaper rate in market and D-mart. I never recommend this product.
-   Very Low Quality, Didnot Match Photgraph /Description At All Package Contents "Mention "Airtight storage Containers"But Is Normal Container "
-   Good packaging and delivery by amazon. containers were of superior quality and leak proof. I got it as a lightning deal for Rs.215 only which was really good.
-   These things are really good. I got it in offer price. It's worth the money. Really far better quality than I expected in this price range. Thank you Amazon
-   if you have no storage provision then you can buy this otherwise wastage of money. too much small and its numbers are very large so not useful someway.
-   not satisfied with product....I bought it for.295 but quality of product is not good...we can get such kind of product in low price in local market
-   it could be better in terms of its quality. despite of several negative reviews i have ordered this item but its not expected by priceware.
-   Nice product at affordable price .product quality is good ..though some container r too small I have found where to utilise them so m happy
-   Average product, plastic quality is not great, but manageable, there are more of the small containers, should have been a better mix
-   small only r for use but for other utility it is gud 4 containers we can use for fridge purpose other containers are 2 small
-   Value for money for quick storage of items, as i got it in a deal for half the price. You can get a better quality but then be prepared to pay that much more. I would not but it at full price though.
-   The title is incorrect for this product on Amazon. The product is precisely "Tenda 150 Mbps MINI Wireless USB Adapter".It is not Nano, but yes it is very tiny, plugs to the USB with only the black chip protruding out. Like the description says, its almost invisible.Fully compatible with RPi2, with OPENELEC Kodi, pure plug and play. It has a pretty decent range coverage.This is absolute must have for RPi. Install Yatse from Google Play and control everything wireless on your RPi
-   After using it for a few days realized its an extremely pathetic product. Doesn't catches signal even when you are 3-4 meters away from the router. Even when it catches signal it is accompanied with frequent signal drops. It connects at 5-9 mbps even when my ISP provides signal at 12 mbps. I wish I could now return the product at get my money back as even 200/- seems too high for this s***ty product. Finally, I would not recommend it even if they put it at Re.1 in lightening deals.
-   This does not fit in a USB slot. You have to push it forcefully. After a few forceful removals from my computer I was afraid it will damage the slot. The makers have not sized the device USB connector correctly.
-   Works really well with my win 7 desktop, speed is really fast
-   Exclent product full bar in 10 meter range,no net drop cheap price also work in window 7,8 a must buy product Tenda W311mi 150mbps.
-   good product in low price, it can connect well in higher speed than other brands, even from far place. I tried it on a CPU from first floor while the router is placed at ground floor, the speed of data transfer is pretty good than expected.
-   Works great. I am very happy that I got this in very low price
-   Good product. Works like a charm. Comes with a CD which you will need to install before you can use the product. Just make sure that when you first install the CD, you plug in the device in the USB port which you plan to use continuously because if you want to change the port later on you'll have to reinstall the CD.
-   Wasted 6 mins of my life ordering it, wasted 30 mins of my life trying to figure out how to set up the damn thing to create a hotspot for my phone from a net cafe
-   Small and simple to connect. Works fine and speed is good.
-   Had used it to connect my office desktop. For this price I would say look no further.
-   Good product. But I found an issue with windows 7. It is not detecting when system switched on. We have to remove and reinsert to get it work. This issue is not always, but sometimes.
-   hardware not strong , when user plug this pen drive many times its damage and out from warranty. so company give 5 year
-   Good service from amazon, and product is also good. Value for money product for any day and using it satisfactorily.
