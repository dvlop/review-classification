- Heats like hell...didnt work for one day after purchase..
- The pen drive not showing in my laptop. Please return it.
- I never had any issues with Sandisk products in the past; however this time they failed to meet my expectations. It worked fine for the first 2 months, but now its not reading in most of the USB devices. I'm very unhappy with this product and I recommend you not to buy this or any steel body Pen Drives as they tend to have some or the other issues within 3 months or so. I purchased it on 27th Jan 2015 and the return date is till 03rd Feb 2015, which holds no good for me :(

- Wrost delivery.Courier man cal , come and get the product.so I dnt want this product.
- Seller is good but sandisk cruzer force is new model not matched to USB port plug.
- dont purchase this item...wont work properly and too slow below as normal usb 2.0
- I cant open files using any music system.. Ths pendrive only open in laptop.
- The pendrive is slightly bigger than the usual USB port size, so in many places the pendrive is very hard to insert and remove!!! Crazy  right??!!!!!!
- It is not good. The look is very much different from what is shown here.
- No expectation Jesi mene ummid kari thi vesa product nahi mila
- Looks good, but very poor coping speed... Max speed 4mbps...
- design is good but speed is very slow for transferring data.
- Very poor copy speed. If you copy from laptop to this pendrive speed will be only 3 mbps. Go for port 3.0 pendrives instead.
- Very very very worst ! Other brand pendrives i have  are now live for years but this one totally crashed in 4months!!!
- Gives a good look and small. But is very slow while copying files, it was 2.0 & is very slow. Dont buy 2.0 buy 3.0
- Worst product. Used it for a month and now its giving write protected error. Not able to write/erase anything on it.
- The transfer rate is 4mbps.S***ty product. Unfortunate. Even my broadband speed is better than this.
- Do not buy this as it is a pen drive which also gives electrical shock when inserted in computer
- Worst design. Doesn't fit in the USB port of almost any laptop. Don't know how they designed it
- Sandisk 16GB Cruzer force USB flash/Pen drive shows only 12 GB when i inserted into system.
- DIFFICULT TO EVEN INSERT TO PC / DESKTOP, MAY EVEN DESTROY THE PC USB PORT.  IT'S SO TIGHT.
- Data transfer speed is very less. Couldn't get more than 4MB/s even on a USB3. 0 port.
- Faulty Piece.. Totally waste of time!!  I got faulty piece from seller. Printer was not able to pool the page so it was useless for printing. Even scaner has non removable stains so it can not scan properly. Then I called technician from HP to solve these issues but he could not solve the problems. Then i applied to return the item and cashback but after two days of schedule dates, no pickup was arranged from amazon. This is very bad experience from amazon. Expecting to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
- Don't buy this printer. You will not be able to refill the cartridge ever. It printer stores the serial number of the cartridge. And when the ink dries, the printer stores this information. And when you refill the cartridge then this printer will show you that &#34;this cartridge must be replaced&#34;. So, if you have no problem in purchasing a new cartridge every time, then this printer is for you. Instead you can buy a printer having inktank.
- Did nor print when connected through USB . Prints only through WiFi. .. Not happy. . Also not able to set back to back print when printed through hpeprint. .
- Paper jams are almost every time. Painful to hang around the printer to feed individual paper for multiple page printing as the device doesn't have an input paper bin
- I received damaged printer. The copy does not come out properly. The left part of photocopy does not come in print out! Now I can not even get refund
- Two side page print is not working. Paper getting stuck.
- As stated above, there has been a problem in hooking it up since delivery. Every time I call HP customer care, they say there is a problem with your laptop, please try using another laptop. Am I supposed to buy another one just to check the printer? They refused to send a service engineer to check the problem too...PATHETIC service by HP India...zero marks to them...  They fixed some features via phone call but then again it failed to print yesterday in spite of all proper connections and settings. It's pointless in buying a wifi scanner when it refuses to scan as well. Really disappointed with HP....  Returning it (thanks to Amazon) where it belongs --HP India...
- hi friend i purchase this product and its very bad product and company claim policy very very bad its scanner bad , orint quility very bad cartraige capacity 20 page maximum colour and 20 b/w print i m so sad znd i think why i purchase this product and why i contact HP dear friend no purchase any one this product otherwise you are crying why i purchase this product
- There was no installation facility given. When instalation done scanner not working. Amazon not even return the product.
- Duplex printing is printing second page only half. So many times tried same result. Waste of paper time and ink. Print resolution is good, but very slow. Setup was easy. But the product is substandard. Purchased because of WiFi. A bad quality product from HP. Returned the product and amazon promptly given the refund.
- Got the product today It is not working returning them back
- Scanner stopped working after a week. Returned the product.
- This is my 3rd and last HP printer and as usual, it sucks.
- Product is working poor. Please solve the issue.
- didnt work satisfactorily even for 6 months!
- Very bad because my new printer courthage finish in just 10 days and printer has showing 3000 copies through this courthage really i have very bad experience from your side for HP products.  In case you feel gillty please give me a one call its my humble request.  Manish Gupta 9971186651,9718422777,918144777
- Printing on photo paper is not up to mark.
- Because its scanner is not working
- Never believe on  online product
- I got A faulty product... Doesn't scans or copy....just showing black strips instead of document which is being scanned...
- i got a defective printer. the roller is not working. Logged a call with HP. they said they will get it repaired
- the cartridges in the new printer were below 50%, this is certainly cheating as the cartridges are expensive.
- Print performance is pathetic . Just 10 color prints. Not recommended if you need heavy color prints.
- Utterly disappointed with product. Received defective piece, home and up navigation keys are not working. Requested for the replacement on the same day. Not satisfied with the retailer
- Not so good and not worth compared to other brands like Cannon / Epson / Brother etc. Ink cartridge yield is very very poor, better think of ink tank revolution. NO MORE LOOTING !
- Major issues with configuration and response time to print. Sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes to get a page printed,
- The printer has problems. Its scanning and copying does not work. It produces dense vertical bands for any copied document. Hence we have asked for a return. It would have been comfortable ,had there been any other authrised person to trouble shoot if it is a minor problem.
- New color ink not working
- You can only print 50 pages with a new cartridge, the cartridge needs to be changed in every 2 days..
- Got a defected product
- Hi can anyone say what is the model number of this printer.  And which cartridge 678  or 672
- Actually I received faulty device. I got refund from amazon. But I am bit disappointed.
- Cost per page is very epensive. Cartridge is not easily available in the market.
- Too much ink usage ..... No supporting material and no installations guider
- Received printer in 1 day but its showing problem with Scanner. Disappointed!!!
- Not user friendly
- The product was damaged during shipping and stopped working the second day.
- Printing price is costly.It is costlier than taking printout in market
- Delivery is satisfied.Product not workable.Complaint to HP Customer care but of no use.Even after about 1month, machine is not useable.
- worst gotta defective piece placed for return n now ma money got stuck for long...God knows till when I'll get d replacement n whether it'll be fine or not....:(...
- I was shipped a defective piece , scan and copy were not working. Immediately put in a return request. I wanted to change my old HP printer but will have to wait.
- I had ordered this printer after going through several reviews. However, the unit I received seemed to be defective and would not even power on when I plugged it in  I had troubleshoot the power on issue which I then realized was a common problem with this printer. Once I went past this issue, I was greeted by another problem where the printer would complete the &#34;initialization' process. After about an hour of  research and several hard boots it got past test print - well then the scan wouldn't work!!!  That was all the patience I could muster to get a printer to work!! I gave up and initiated a 'return'
- Received product not working properly. It was very difficult for return this product for replacement since amazone not having return pickup in Navimumbai
- Had nothing but problems with this printer ever since I received it ,drinking the ink and poor photo quality .not getting anywhere with the on line help
- It says WiFi but terrible performance every time we have to give a print we need to shut and re start the printer very slow and not user friendly at all
- printer what we have purchased was came with dry cartridge we had hardly got 10 printout which is not acceptable from the product like HP.
- The Printer is very slow. Looks nice. But my older HP k209A all in one printer is wayy faster. Did not print on a day when I needed prints urgently. Malfunction. Had to return it. Pls check before buying. Could be just my printer. Still need to check.
- So I bought this printer and it proved to be manfuntional. The scanner wouldn't work. Customer care connected me to the hp seevice center which wouldn't answer my calls. I'm REALLY annoyed cause its been like 10 days now. You better do something.
- Not having prefect accessories in package
- This is the worst experience I've had. Hu doesn't work, whatever you do it gives out an error saying incompatible cartridge. It just doesn't accept the cartridge,to be honest I'm really dissapointed with this printer.I've returned it to the seller. I hope I'll find a fine printer soon.
- I purchased this product of HP after doing a lot of online research. However its one of the most disappointing HP product I have ever used. The paper tray always takes 2-3 pages at a time causing a paper jam every time I print. I had to literally insert every single page individually while printing. Within a month of its purchase it has now stopped working. It was even a challenge to activate the wireless option. As it cant be returned after 10 days you don't have a choice except to carry the product to the service centre (to my utter disappointment there are just 2 centres in whole of Delhi). In todays busy schedule its really difficult for any one to carry it to service centre for any problem. I am really disappointed with the product as I had great expectations from HP. I don't recommend to use this product to anyone.
- I installed the printer on the 4th august. Started  facing problems from 7th of august. Finally I complained to HP thinking it was probably installation error. Today the engineer came and said the card in the printer is defective. Please tell me what should be done
- not a good experience with the product......initially was not getting connected with the wifi direct for printing....now not even the printer is getting switched on....need to take to the doctor.. within two months of purchase!!!!
- Firstly, on arrival it didn't recognise the ink cartridge as valid (the cartridge came packed with the printer), for which we had to contact the local service centre. Turns out there was a defective chip-set. Secondly, the paper keeps jamming inside the printer for some reason. Yet to get that fixed.  I don't know whether its a design flaw or just this piece is defective, but such instances erode one's faith in online shopping where you can't check the device for defects until it is already at your doorsteps. I won't be buying any more electronic pieces from the net anymore.
- The Setup CD is of some different model HP 3540 instead of the one which should be applicable for HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 e-All-in-One Printer. Not sure for the complete authenticity
- Hello I m not happy with the product I want to send back
- I received non working product and still waiting for refund.
- SCAN not working on the device. printer and  wifi are fine. i missed the return by date due to travel so am stuck with the allin one device that can only print but not SCAN.
- Not working now. only yellow and black print working.
- Worst Product.. Alla in chinies.. Can't operate software.. Total waste.. Buy indian or reputed brand. Scrap this s***
- The CD being supplied by the company does not have the driver but some junk software piece of code. Do not buy this product else you will waste your money. There is no way to get the same even from internet from the company site or any other place as only driver support is for window8 and not for win7 or xp. Even for win8 driver  the download is even too slow that you will not do it
- Bought it to use with my Raspberry Pi 2. It got detected out of the box with Raspbian and Ubuntu MATE. But, the device has really low range! Shows no signal in my next room, which is just 10 feet away! Connection was dropping off all the time. Buy this if you have to use it on a device in the same room as your WiFi router is kept. Really disappointed.
- worst product of all time. not able to install by itself like other devices. Not even when installed by driver setup which is given with the product. Request was accepted for its return but such a long process to return 250/- product and some  amount also was to be deducted. who will take such a pain.
- The device is of very poor quality. It stopped working in 10 days. The product needs to be returned within 10 days to be eligible for return instead of usual 30 days. So I am stuck with this and its completely useless. Please dont buy and waste your money otherwise be prepared to throw it in garbage bin.
- Sucksss with rpi's, don't expect range to be much as 2m away from the router, showed only 2 bars on my raspberry pi, but yeah works out of the box and serves the purpose.. Seller veedee is decent enough to call up after sales.. Plus one star for that P.S PATHETIC RECEPTION ONE STAR PRODUCT
- The worst product I ever bought. It's working dead slow. taking long time to connect to a wifi. when I found it was not working properly, the return date was finished, so I cant able to return it.  I don't have rating below 1 star, that's why I'm rating it as 1 or else it 0 rating.
- This adapter has very poor signal reception. I had to move my router very close to it (3 meters distance) and in the same room. I was using it for my media center PC. After around 10 switch ON/OFF cycle it failed. Its completely dead and I don't know how to claim warranty.
- Its good...But once connected to the PC the network is very slow. Speed of the internet should be 157 mbps as written on the box.But the speed we are getting is 0.44 mbps.It is not all good and not at all compatible.Kindly replace the same or refund the amt.Thanks.
- Device is good but it does not give good connectivity. My connection is 5mbps, i get same when i do test on my laptop using wifi, but when i use this device it gives my only 0.6mbps speedtest result.  I would not recommend to buy this.
- No technical support provided had to call multiple number of times to get the settings configured on my pc
- not compatible. already requested for return the same. not communicated so far. no refund has been given.
- Got defective in less than five months and that too when used occassionly. I think quality is not good.
- This gets connected to wifi but it will not be connected for long time. Gets disconnected frequently.
- Hey!! If our PC have a internet connection like broadband.. By this adapter we can make as WiFi ??
- Pathetic signal strength .. it shows very feeble signal though my wifi router is in the next room
- Not Working with Raspberry pi any distro. When asked seller he always he lied to me each time.
- bad quality product, automatic disconnections, slow speed. could afford my 30mbps broadband
- Never ever ship using IPS ... These guys are absolute waste, the greatest lathargic people.
- They did not work. I returned them and asked for a refund still dont know if its refunded.
- Doesn't work after door closed, router is just 3 meters away. In Laptop I could see 4 bars. But in this device it varies like hell and frequently gets disconnected.
- this product is malfunctioning after installing drivers and opening the related software it doesn't do anything doesn't work this is crap. i will have it replaced.
- Bad product. Connects and disconnects every few seconds. Tested another dongle to check if the signal was weak but it worked fine. This product is a waste of money
- Very poor wifi adapter...its a worst wifi adapter i have ever purchased...its not working always.....continuously i cant use that wifi adapter....so distracting
- Pathetic product. Wifi is very fluctuating. Shows limited connectivity most of the time. If you use with a wireless mouse, then the dongle almost stops working.
- Poor quality product i puchased 2 from other beands they are working fine. But great service by amazon. Product pickupup and initiated refund . thanks amazon
- It doesn't work. Stopped working the day i received it. It started, an hour later, nothing at all. Bad product. I'd like such a product removed from the list
- I brought this product 2 days back It shows connected but don't work.  Can't able to open google also Waste of money. Don't buy
- It was mentioned in the technical specification that this product is for windows 8.1also, but it is not working in windows 8.1. Very poor
- Worst device . Dnt buy . Signal lost evry time . Whole day is wasted in plug in and plug out . Save your self but any better device .
- Everything is in Chinese or Korean... cant understand anything. Waste
- Device has the problems with signal strength, Coverage area is too small (5-6 ft) without having any wall in between. Works with almost with Laptop with Linux, windows OS. I have used this device with RaspberryPI works good.
- Could hardly get WiFi, when it did it was roughly 1/10th of the speed it should have got. Consider This one instead: http://www.flipkart.com/leoxsys-leo-hg150n-usb-adapter/p/itmdpxwbwxt5zk2y?pid=USBDPXW7H3J2ABKX
- Comfast CF-WU810N V2.0 - 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n 150Mbps USB 2.0 Wireless Wi-Fi working good. but price is too more ' I Parcheesi out market lowest price other brand wi fi modem. Those are equal working performance.
- It stop working after a new software or any update is been installed. It makes the system too slow to work,it works only in serving and when the download began it dies and speed drop to 1 to 2 kbps ..........
- Initially it worked fine but within two weeks it started disconnecting from our home WiFi.needs to be constantly plugged in and out and troubleshooted through the pc. Very disappointed with this product.
- The signals goes low when its in another room.  Not met my requirement.  Its a waste of money.  They say that within a range of 50 feet (indoors) we will have good wifi strength.  But its not.  Sorry
- Installed sw as mentioned but screen which shows active wifi devices doesnt have all attributes on the top as shown in handbook...overall not able to see any active connection hence not able to use.
- I am writing this review after using several months.  Wrost product ever its shows full signal but not connecting to the router. No service centres, no proper response from seller.
- Product does not give desired outcome. Frequent drop in connection after using this comfast wifi dongle. Internet speed also far poorer than one with direct lan cable connection.
- Build quality is terrible and speeds are just about at par with a USB 2.0 drive. Not recommended at all.  The plastic is very cheap and brittle and switching between OTG and full-size USB connector is clunky. To top it off, write speeds barely exceeded 10mbps even when connected to a USB 3.0 port.  It's a good thing Amazon has a great returns policy. :)
- Problematic connecting it to a computer or phone , as the toggle switch lock slips and has to be physically  held in place to be inserted into USB.
- This product will feel very poor quality. Very flimsy plastic.  Product working fine as USB thumb drive, no longer works as OTG (may be just me),  tried on Moto G3, G2, Zenfone.  Requested a refund, not yet got one (Not even came to collect the product)  Disappointed by product and service.
- Though OTG is good feature, this device is not good. Issue is with slider which got loose within first week of purchase. And since slider lock was not working properly, it is hard to connect this device with laptop.  I had returned it and now looking for another device without slider.
- This item is defective as this is not working well with my Moto g3 mobile ,when I connect it to mobile and transfer some data in few seconds it shows device removed so I can't use this item .and also I can't delete/ paste data to this from my laptop Sony . so this item is useless for me.
- I don't know if I received a faulty piece or its a problem in the design, the slider has no strength whatsoever when I try to plug it in my laptop or tv slider moves back and the same happens with mobile,  I need to hold the slider with thump and then only I can plug it successfully
- I had connected the OTG to my mobile &amp; tried to copy the movie in it, but it gets disconnects. Same problem in another mobile also. When I used my friends OTG it got copied properly. That  means the amazon OTG is defective. So please arrange to replace it
- Im not satisfied, i buyed this product in offer for 499/- . It is very slow with written speed only of less than 15.0mbps always in 3.0 usb port also. Please provide good product when ever they buy with offer or without. It's really bad on your part amazon.
- product is ok but this time I am not satisfied with the product space., in 32gb otg pen drive there is only space of 28.94gb it means 3.6gb less then the original space. . so for that I am giving only 1 star that too for Amazon not for the Pen dirive
- It's automatically removed when we are adding or copying something. Sometime it's take long time to connect and few seconds it's removed automatically. Don't know whats the problem with this, even I have checked this other mobile phone as well.
- Not working for mobile pin
- Don't buy! Not working since purchase, requested return a same day when received yet their is no action taken.
- Didnt work well for me and have returned it back next day. It has been 7 days and still waiting for my refund.
- Aweful product, not working properly. Also the product is not as shown in the image. I'm really disappointed.
- Not yet used. Got just now...but size shows 28 gb out of 32 gb......this is cheating....no where specified so
- The product I received is not of good quality . It's slider is not working . Very disappointed from amazon
- Pen drive is not in good condition and while I transfer small amount of data it hanged for so much time .
- OTG micro USB does not work properly. Poor design for the switch between two drives , not strong enough.
- Does not fit in nexus 6p
- Pen drive is not detected in the android think there might be a problem, so I had applied a replacement
- It says its 32gb but it is not it is 28gb .. I believe this product is the one sold on cstm manish market.. I pitty again I wasted my funds
- This product is very  poor,  don't buy it wastage of money. Products are pre defective.  The slider of usb is loose.  Not durable  product.
- It gives problem while inserting pen drive in mobile. Even when pen drive is inserted in mobile then also sometimes it gets rejected
- Its too slow. it write speed is very slow and read speed is like memory card of class 4. I suggest you don't buy this..... :-(
- i have purchase this pen drive i connected pc and laptop its permormance is very well but its not detected in my moto e (2nd gen )
- it is not all detecting in mobile  poor performance..  If i get a chance would prefer to return back to AMZON
- Can't connect to Android mobile
- The other side doesnt work just after 3 days, gets quite heated up when plugged in to PC or phone. The product is made in China
- this product is very delicate to handle, chances of getting damaged is high... better to go with other models in Sandisk...
- This products sucks.just working on 1 mobile.amazon needs to sell more trustworthy products.donot go for this product
- it was dam bad one only pen drive side worked..but otg didn't worked.only..when I thought of returning time was over
- Crap...crap..crap.. After a month or 2 the product storage is damaged.. It is now showing only 14.2 MB only....
- No, Sometimes it is not properly connect to MOBILE . Data transfer speed is good but connectivity is major problem.
- I am not satisfied with this product.... Because on paper & on product show 16. GB but at actually it is 14 GB
- Any one grand 2 not supported I am not purchase cable with cable it's working are not working any one help me......
- Just a month after purchase. Does not display files when used on tab. Happened after return period. Waste of money.
- Very bad , please dont oder
- Not working useless product
- worst product from sandisk. mini adaptor for phone connection not inserting in any phone. for me it's useless now.
- I have received SONY 16 GB pen drive instead of SanDisk ultra 16 GB 2.0 OTG Flash Drive. Please see the matter.
- speed is very good but knob given on side to operate usb is not very good b`coz as i tried to insert pendrive to my laptop portion of usb gows inside because of poor locking system
- Otg pendrive not working, dont know who will take responsibility ,do not know whom to to contact or call, if I had purchased in shop, I would know, where to go.
- Pen Drive shown after 3 to 5 mins of insert for PC and Mobile hang some time when i insert to mobile /...  m not satisfy with this product ...
- not so good. ok product and below the expectations. OTG flash side is still not compatible with my nokia lumia and galaxy tab-4. poor product in this sense.
- Not compatible with every smartphone,  also it  gets automatically formatted if trying to copy or move files from device to it leaving a folder named lost
- the otg does not connects defective piece, didnt know the return window close in 10 days, connect the pendrivefor 5 min n it gets very hot waste of money
- the main USP of this working with both phone and pc.. but failed to fullfil this feature.. no response while connecting with android phone ..PATHETIC !!
- The product heats up like a fry pan It's not at all sturdy The retractation of either sides seems as though it might the break any moment
- Heats up very quickly. Slider is not smooth enough. My friend has the other similar SanDisk OTG which is smoother and doesnt heat up too.
- This pendrive have a serious heating problem. Even made my mobile very hot. Returned! Will order the non otg model and use it with otg cable.
- Guys dont buy this pendrive. Usb 3.0 is just for name it has very low transfer rates just like a normal pendrive sometimes even low, its transfer speed changes very much and dont have a constant tranfer rate go for hp if you want 3.0 pendrive.
- I am copy BAHUBALI 1080p with 4.29GB file size and free space of pan drive is 14.2GB but it is not copy in drive and show an error file is to large for the destination file system..... please solve this problam aur replace pan drive
- Faltu and worst..it gets very very very heated during using
- Product is the worst.! Very poor build quality and performance. The slider doesn't stay in place and the housing can rip apart at any moment. Please don't buy it at any cost. I had to return mine within 2 days.!
- Oh.. bad experience with such a good brand. I had to return it in couple of days as the pendrive was not getting detected on my machine. Thanks to Amazon for the smooth return policy in place.
- most important Drawback is heat ..... i have older version 2.0 otg it work similer in terms of speed But it doesnot it . so i think Older 2.0 Otg Is better as compare to this
- Defective product...Customer care is pathetic... Dont waste your money. Was thinking of a cheaper option to back up data..finally I bought WD passport Ultra and is highly satisfied...
- Not happy as SanDisk Ultra 32GB USB 3.0 OTG Flash Drive. is not working with my Samsung grand 2 mobile. also the button at then side for opening closing drives does not work properly
- First of all the speed of transfer in my pc is very slow around 18mb/sec, also the other port i.e  OTG port to connect to smartphones is not working. really disappointed by Amazon.
- Used it for just 3 months and now its dead. Well it has warranty for that I have to spent my valuable time and travel expense. I would consider buying another one, not sandisk though.
- I got this card today and tried to register on samsung site but site showing invalid serial no. and looking like a fake chinese card .. returning this s*** .....😡😡😡 if u NOTICE properly my pic the things written on this card is in balck while it must be of grey colour and there is no arrow sign after EVO ..... total FAKE
- Its a duplicate Samsung EVO mentioned made in Philippines original. But the original brand should be Made in korea. I have tested it h2test software to check its speed n authenticity its Writing speed: 4.96 MByte/s Reading speed: 10.2 MByte/s the result is this :- Warning: Only 15270 of 15271 MByte tested. The media is likely to be defective. 14.9 GByte OK (31270908 sectors) 1.0 MByte DATA LOST (2052 sectors) Details:1020 KByte overwritten (2040 sectors) 0 KByte slightly changed (&#60; 8 bit/sector, 0 sectors) 6 KByte corrupted (12 sectors) 1020 KByte aliased memory (2040 sectors) First error at offset: 0x0000000238f28240 Expected: 0xc011b754c4681a40 Found: 0x9b8a50175fe91a40 H2testw version 1.3 Writing speed: 4.96 MByte/s Reading speed: 10.2 MByte/s H2testw v1.4
- I received the fake one........ As mentioned by many other reviewers,I too found the following  1.No arrow sign after EVO logo....(I have googled so hard and concluded that genuine sd cards have that arrow...) 2.Black colour writing instead of grey.... 3.Made in Philippines......(written on the sd card) 4.Manufactured in Korea.....(written on the back sticker which is pasted above the original back cover....I just peeled it...possibly fake sticker.......) 5.MRP.599 written on the pack! But the original product's price is Rs.699...........(How can a genuine product be 100 rs. cheaper than the MRP. mentioned by Amazon?.....) 6.It gives 16GB memory...... but I don't support using fake products  7.The back cover says it is made in Korea but the memory card says it is made is Philippines....Which one should I believe ?  Be careful while buying this product..........Many get the fake product and &#34;only some take it serious&#34;.....Don't support fake products guys.....that will be a small step for building a good nation.....Buy at your own risk!  You can also see some reviewers complaining that their card is not working after 2 months.... So beware.Better get this product from any official Samsung Store near your place!  If you still don't believe me,go google for samsung memory cards without arrow sign......you won't find any.....because original cards have that sign......Don't forget that I have mentioned many other points too...
- Awesome copy of Samsung. I am so proud of Amazon. MRP of this sd card is 700 but we know Amazon have there own Samsung which have different MRP of products.
- Hello friends dont buy this memory card , really it was duplicate.I found it through samsung customer care.If you have doubt call to samsung cusomer care and check it.Amazon is worst..cheating customers..I want no one should be cheated here after..dnt buy friends..
- Very bad product. Became faulty within six months of purchase. Seller warranty is for 10 years. But how to claim it, it is no where written. Lost valuable data and photos.
- plese don't buy this fake memory card! I think this product is a replica of the original samsing evo 32gb memory card. by the first day itself the memory card got automatically formatted! cannot save applications in android device! rest of the things okkeyy ie.(physical appearance is good.)... keep on automatically formating
- Amazon's service & product quality is good but Product I received has an invalid serial number & the Samsung website refuses to accept it while registering the warranty I believe Amazon should intervene and help me register the warranty.
- I got this card today and looking like a fake chinese card .. returning this if u NOTICE properly the things written on this card is in balck while it must be of grey colour and there is no arrow sign after EVO ..... total FAKE (cloudtail) ith oru mathiri mattedathe paripadi aayi poyi bhaii...

- thank you amazon for giving me a fking fake product. it is mentioned on the cover that it is imported and marketed by &#34; samsung india electronics Pvt Ltd.&#34; but when i scaned the bar code ( which is additional sticker pasted on the correct discription) the link redirects to Reliance degital( very funny). The color of the memory card is yellowish not orange and there is no arrow mark which can be seen on all genuine samsung memory cards. The actual read and write speed of this s..t is nowhere near the orginal. and finally with the last hope i tried to register in samsung website, then i came to conclude that its a pure fake. the most funny part is that it is from &#34;cloudtail amazon&#34; and so called amazon fulfilled. lost ma trust on amazon. please give ma money back or give me a genuine one else please dont do this to anyone else.
- -The MicroSDHC card got corrupted within first week of use. -The Samsung service centre is only one in pune (at Gultekadi) and with no nearby pickup points in pune -The Service centre is out of stock and will only confirm in next week that is 19-08-15 -Think before you buy, always buy two because you need one for backup
- Pathatic Product from Samsumg ... I am a fool that i bought this product instead of everyone recommended other brands. this memory card has stopped working with in 20 days and i lost all my data saved... and now even worst experience regarding replacement of this product... no one is taking responsibility for this product.. even samsung stores do not replace products purchased from Amazon.com... I really dont know where to go and who will replace it. this is the worst experience of my life... i am giving 1 star because i have to.. this is the minimum rating i have to give..  I feel cheated by Amazon.in because Samsung service centre denied to replace this micro SD card because it is not an Indian product and doesnt come under indian warrenty...
- Bought this card 6 months back and my phone is reporting as defective now. I have not even removed the card after installation first time. Highly disappointed... All my data is also lost... I tried to search online for Samsung's Bangalore Service Centre for memory card and could not find one. Have asked this question in the product page and waiting for response. I am hoping at least the vendor (Cloudtail) will respond. Based on response, I will update this review.  <a class='a-link-normal' href='/Samsung-EVO-32GB-Class-10-MicroSDHC-Memory-Card-with-Adapter-Upto-48-Mbps-speed/dp/B00L543E3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8'>Samsung EVO 32GB Class 10 MicroSDHC Memory Card with Adapter (Upto 48 Mbps speed)</a>
- Fake card.. Crashed in 5 months.. Lost all my personal data.. Got refunded from amazon.
- After using this Micro SD card for not just 45 days, the card went kaput. Completely disappointed as i bought this card specially after reading the rave reviews and because it's a Samsung Product. I tried to use the card on different phones but it won;t work at all. I can't even return it as it's out of 15 days return policy.  All my photos and videos taken and saved in the card are no longer retrievable. This Card sucks. stay away from Samsung Micro SD cards. you just can't trust them.
- Within six months of moderate use on my Samsung Galaxy phone, this card got corrupted by itself.. tried everything from formatting in the phone and then again reformatting from the pc.. but to no avail.. Lost precious data which is never to be recovered. Being a photographer i was working on a project from past 3 months but all went to s***.. made me realize that brands which are specific for such products (in this case Sandisk) should only be used and nothing else.
- Not worth even one star.. Received on 27 dec and stopped working on 30th dec.. Got corrupted..  Formatting the card not working.. Not able to delete anything from it.. Its coming back automatically.. Cant send it for replacement, since i have personal data in it.. Data is accessible but delete function is not working.. First time i purchased samsung sd card.. And result was this.. 625' got wasted.. Have no option other than destroying it myself
- Was disappointed since I was unable to register it on Samsung's website because it would not recognise the product's registration/serial number. Stopped working after 3 months. The same 'Unable to erase' - 'Unable to format' error. Got in touch with Samsung Customer Support, but it will take time to reach them since their centre is at the other side of town.
- Received this product and after use of 1.5 month, the card stopped working. It is not able to be read by any of the device. Seems some duplicate chinese product. I would suggest not to buy this
- It was working properly, but only few days... after its is not working now, return policy date also crossed. I lost my data as well as amount paid for this product. I am helpless now.
- It stopped working just after 20 days. I was not satisfied at all. though I ordered another from same vendor. But i have the same issue in it now. Bad product. Don't buy from cloudtail.
- Data Read/Write Speed is very bad, i think sd card class 4 speed is much better thin this. i found Data Read/Write Speed around 6MB/s... Its too bad so friends don't bye this.
- Very slow data transfer speed while uploading and downloading. Not as per specification given as Reading Speed upto 48MB/s Writing Speed upto  10MB/s, it is 615 KB/s to 755 KB/s.
- I didnot receive a genuine product.. The product is looking different from original.. Not having the triangular sign and letters are black on colour ( which should be grey in colour)
- I had purchased a 16 GB memory card of samsung company on 25 nov 2014.But within 1 year this memory card gets corrupted.I cannot delete existing data or cannot copy new data in it.
- It claims 48mb/s but the lousy card returned a max of 15mb/s and further dropped down. This is my first and last Samsung product.
- Damage product.  I bought this from amozone, but after 7 day it damaged,  it's not working properly. SanDisk memory card is better than dis, we should go for sandisk. ..
- This memory card is not like class 10 in the features shows 48 mb/s transferred speed but it gives transfer speed like class 6 memory card I don't like this product
- This Samsung memory card is dublicate.It is not of class 10. I am very upset from Amazon .Their is no arrow mark in front and it is made in philipins. I waste my money on this product of amazon. Plz amazone not to show fake details.
- My Samsung micro rd card64GB class 10 is not install  in my mobile, I tried  but mobile show msg.that card is damaged  so do not purchased  samsung sd card & I trust Amazon  online  shopping  but now Amazon  is also selling duplicate  thing
- stupid materials after 1 month not working if i return amazon also not supporting
- Once it was stuck and I was not able to access memory card where in forcefully I have to format to make memory card in working condition. Earlier this also i have purchased same product where in now I m not able to access sd card at all
- Worst product..... Of SAMSUNG,  by Amazon shop.... I have purchased it after 3 months,  it shows.. Memory card damaged, automatically,..  Very  worst product.... By  samsung evo 32 GB class 10...dont purchase,
- NOT EVEN WANTED TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT -1000 STAR RATING!! TOTALLY FAKE!! DON'T BUY IT. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY IN BUYING IT!! SAMSUNG MEMORY CARD ARE MADE IN KOREA . THIS ONE IS MADE IN PHILLIPENS . TOTALLY FAKE!!
- I can not format the data in SD Card, if i delete all the data from SD Card than re insert the card in phone, all the old data automatically recovered.  I can not delete all the data permanently from SD card/
- Initially it looked good, but the card got corrupt as soon as I changed my phone! By research I found it is original Samsung and not fake, still no chance of recovering it! I lost a large chunk of my data and media..
- DONT PURCHASE IT.AUTOMATICALLY DATA ERASED.IF YOU CALL CUSTOMERS CARE THEN THEY WILL REFER TO SERVICE CENTRE BUT SERVICE CENTRE IS AT AHMEDABAD ONLY AND NAGPUR AT MAHARASHTRA ONLY. LOTS OF PROBLEM WITH THIS.
- Received a fake product.. the card shd be dark orange and shd have an arrow mark. Had received a original product when I buyed from the same user 3 months back. Now just received a fake one. Thumbs down to seller
- I had got the product and it found lot of irritation with.After inserting and using for 3 months it shows the notification sd card damaged u need to format it. after doing it i lost all my imp photos and videos.
- First of all to differentiate between fake and original by looking is:- 1. The ink used to print, the original one is written with grey and must have an arrow, but fake is written in black and no arrow found.  2. Check where it is made, the card should be made in Korea, some card are also showing made in Philippines. ( Samsung also assembling its memory card in Philippines) , but if you find made in Taiwan its fake  3. The boundary of memory card should be white if it is black then go refund/ replace it.  And all above you can register sereal no. On Samsung website and check yourself.
- 3 months ago i was bought this card. and it was damaged last day... and ots speed is very low. dont buy this product. my card is now useless..... plsss noone buy this worst product
- The card became DEAD in just 2 months of use and I have lost all my data! When contacted the Samsung customer support they also declined to help with data recovery, though agreed to replace the card.
- I have placed an order Samsung 16GB EVO memory card, when I saw storage its just 14.91GB available only and I didn't any single bite. Samsung is fraud making us fool I just saying don't buy. Ok
- The memory card was supplied to me without adapter. The card becomes non-functional within three months. In cannot be even formatted either on phone or computer. Very bad product. Total wastage of money.
- Buy only if customer care centre is available in your city. Within 6 months memory card got corrupted and authorized service centre is not available in my city. Poor quality....less durability product
- This is worst product.stopped working after 3 months.dont buy this
- Don't purchase this because it is showing 64gb on it but the available memory is 59.4 gb only and the transfer speed is very low & while transferring the data it automatically stopped in the middle.
- Second time I received duplicate product against one purchase order. As I said earlier that Samsung original EVO card must have an ARROW sign after the word EVO. But this product doesn't contain.
- I  ordered 32GB memory card with adapter,  I got only memory card. I didn't get adapter with that package
- The card shown here in the website is oringinal one. But they will deliver you the fake one. In the picture, the one I am holding is the one which they delivered. As you can see the card does not have arrow aftre EVO. Also the SAMSUNG logo on the top should be like other picture. The other picture is the original one.
- Dnt buy it. I buy it a week ago and now it get write protected self without Autorin virus. Also getting complaint from my frnd who snt getting audio in movies which are in card. Its not a good product. I think its same duplicate card that is sold outside Old Delhi rly stn in 100/-
- very disappointed. first it never arrived, I got the money back and had to order it again. I finally got it, put it in and it worked - I put all my pictures and videos on and then, 4 months later, it stopped working. now all my movies are gone and the card doesn#t work anymore.
- I had bought this, I connected card with my laptop after opening the package. Copied few files, later I put it in my phone, It shows nothing, I couldn't format too.  Its totally waste of my money :( please do buy this from this seller/ product. please visit the shop and buy.

- I had ordered Samsung eco 32 GB memory card with adaptor .I get memory only I did not get adaptor,while there is another option for same memory card for only 7rupeess,I had paid 789 because of memory and adapter but I did not get a any adapter .don't buy this fraud
- Within four months memory card got corrupted resulting loss of data and making card totally useless. Neither card is responding or could be re-formatted. Didn't expect inferior quality from Samsung. Moreover now I am not eligible to replace or return this product.
- Fake.. Fake.. Its a fake product.as mentioned by so many people. In its cover its written as manufactured in korea and in the memory card it's written as made in philippines. Cannot register for warranty in samsung because serial number is not valid.
- I too received a fake samsung sd memory card 1. i have refered with arrow near by evo and 2.text written is in black color insted of grey color i am totally fed up with amazon whenever i received any electronic goods from amazon
- When i bought it was working good. But now it showing only 28GB drive. Rest of the spaces are vanished. Even it is not taking format also. Then i go to the Samsung Care & they are making me disappointed by saying they don't have any software to making it right. (Even still it's in warranty).  Plz help... (Special Request to the Seller & Amazon)
- Sometimes couldn't unmount sd card.After software update the apps installed on sd card becomes unavailable.Sometimes show message to format the card.Speed is very slow when compared to class 10 card.No designation on the card to prove it to be a class 10 card.Only advantage is we can shine in front of friends as samsung card is not so popular.
- While I'm keeping memory card to my mobile my device getting hange and not working. Even touch also not working. And one more thong, as these online shopping websites are writing 5Year warranty it will not be claimed as samsung is not responsible for the warranty they said and samsung confirmed it totally depends in the shopping providers.
- Very bad quality. I purchased it for my new MI Pad. By the time I received all my products the return date limit was crossed. When I mounted the card in the pad, it did not work. Then I tried it in my Note2 but it did not work at all. I don't know whether supplier will replace it or not. Request Amazon to intervene and help replacement.
- Item delivered promptly. However, the print over the mem card differ from the image in seller listing. Change in colour of the print and no arrow.  ****Most importantly, the serial number on the SD card is not getting registered with Samsung product registration. Hence returning the item. Seems the item is a fake.****
- Customer service center are at 300 KM from my home location,Its like TO REPLACE YOUR MEMORY CARD WITH ORIGINAL BILL you require more transportation Cost and lost of 1 Day.  They can deliver you new product home but for service they can't....how can we trust on Brand like Samsung???????????  i talk with Customer care about service issue they are saying you have only one option left you have to go to Ahmedabad(Gujarat) from Vapi (Gujarat) 350Km Approx. with original bill and you can get replace.  sandisk is really a good product i bought 3 pendrive and 2 memory card but till date no complain about its warrenty service i replace 1 memory card and 1 pendrive in 20Km Distance from my Home.  Very poor Service by Samsung  Whats the Use of 5 Year of warranty??????????  For Samsung in hindi Teri Surat aa Thuuuu teri Surat aa thuuuu
- I wanted to buy Samsung 32 GB micro card for my Mobile phone. I did a big big mistake by ordering it from amazon it seems. It doesn't work at all. I had a memory card worth 8 gb and wanted to upgrade to 32GB. Transferring the data to the new card took me some time, however now that I am wanting to return the useless card it's showing me the return policy. I was a great fan of amazon and used to recommend every one to shop from amazon however after this horrible experience I am dead sure not to buy anything fro you. First and foremost you'll have sold a faulty product (am sure you must have got reviews just like mine for this product ) on top if that the return policy doesn't allow customer to return the defective piece. Need less to say your business has grown in india market. and you'll are loosing loyal customers. The business may grow for few months however it will not continue for sure.
- Card was has not worked since I gifted it. The phone is unable to recognise it. Other cards are working fine with the same phone. Not able to format the card either. Unable to get information to return/replace it. The Samsung India website does not have this card model number listed so unable to process warranty claim!
- THIS CARD IS NOT GENUINE If anyone bought this card please  compare with it the given image.Like the small arrow after EVO and the color of the description &#34;microsd hc&#34; is somewhat ash in original in this  card it is black. And the irony is i was brought to this seller by samsung official website!!!
- There is difference in the quality.I didn't get what is shown in the product details. It work fine though. Speed is way too low than what we expect from a class 10 sd card. I immediately placed refund request right on the day I received it. Waiting for the COURIER WALA to pick it up. They are late by 24 hrs.
- Card  corrupt after 2 months usage. Don't buy this item
- I have received a fake Samsung Evo 16GB Class 10 micro SDHC Card. The product I received has no SIDE ARROW mark as shown in the product image on the website. UNEXPECTED!
- Dont purchase. Chip not format &amp; we cant use. U can call me 08146618511 (varinder kumar) for more details of this product. Duplicate product. Wrong returned adrress.
- No any Samsung Service centre  taking responsibility of Warranty of my 32 GB SMSUNG evo SD card .. SD card is come with  10 years Warranty
- Warranty registration failed as Sr.no. is not being accepted.What's about tall claim of &#34;10 YEARS WARRANTY&#34;.Or should we presume that the product is a FAKE one.
- The product stopped working from yeasterday after 2 months of usage. It was suddenly stopped worked while I was playing songs in my mobile.  Fake product!!
- Very bad experience. I used it for my mobile and after 4 months it is not working,unreadable by mobile and laptop. Please suggest me about warranty service
- Memory card corrupted not working in another mobile
- Its not giving speed more than 10mbps dont buy this
- Speed is slow not fast as comparative class10 cards
- It's my 3rd purchase with Amazon and first time I am totally dissapointed. First time I received such a worse /fake item from Amazon. So Return initiated.
- I have buyed this memory card a week ago,when I booked my card that time the original mrp was 1299 but now it reduced to 948.this is real cheating by amazon
- I got a fake card and i shall tell u hw i found out. som people r saying if the printing on card is in black instead of gray its a fake. Som people are saying even though its printed in black its original.........I got such a card which i ordered on 15th oct.......printing is in black......i had my doubts so i check for the following 1) i checked for writing speed its 9mbps instead of the mentioned 48mbps 2) original packing is not pure white its dirt white in color 3) edges of memory card are not pointed like the original card 4) when i turned back the package i found a sticker with manufactured by samsung electronis KOREA writings on it. but on the lower left its mentioned  Made in Phillippines (made in both phillippines and korea for indian market? hahaha) 5)here comes the fun part (refer the attached pics) i lifted the sticker up and was surprised to see two different barcodes and two different serial numbers (Sno on sticker-8 806086 078467 with model code MB-MP16D/IN And Sno below the sticker read -8 806086 078160 with model code MB-MP16D/APC)   IN on model number refers to INDIA and APC refers to AMAZON PIRACY CORPORATION i think........seems like amazon has its own pirate market producing counterfeit products. If u get such a product then it is a fake and u may loose ur valuable data one day if u decide to live with it.
- Bought it in Oct 2015,its Jan 2016 and not working!! I had saved data in the memory card bought from Amazon but all gone. Lower the price lower the grade!!
- I received a samsung micro sd card from amazon in Oct and it worked fine for 3 months... now the card is not working and I don't know what to do with it.
- Its a fake SD Card.  I got a fake card today.Cloudtail replaces it with genuine, it will be ok. If not. I'll complain against Cloudtail.
- Its not even one & half months snc i got it & suddenly it stopped downloading pictures & audios ....14gb still left... I donno wat is the problem :( :(
- Not a good product... After using it for 2 months its not working... And Amazon.in did not help me with this matter... Though it is in warranty period
- i had stored some movies in the sd card one day and when i checked after some days in computer the sd card was empty there where about 20 to 30 movies
- i have ordered the memory card two months before some around 30th September and now it is not responding at all so i'm not satisfied with the product
- Tranfer of files not fast as mentioned- 48mb/s.
- My stop working in 4months.I called samsung care they told me to bring card at service centre which 500 kms away and they refuse to accept courier .
- This is not a class 10 at all and the transfer rate is just 3-4 Mbps which is well below than a class 6 SD card. Am not satisfied with this product
- I got damage means corrupted memory card... Dhoka diya hai....amazon walo ne...aur non refundable hai ye...aisa bol rahe hai...helpline wale..
- Pathetic product. Bought two numbers, both failed within 3 months of purchase. Lost all data. And unit rendered useless. No amount of attempts successful in recovering the units.  Never expected brand name SAMSUNG to deliver such products and also Amazon also should take necessary steps to blacklist such products or issue warnings  we still have faith with Samsung to do something to retain it brand value and recall the units from the VICTIMS
- This card gives maximum 25-28 mbps speed.which is half of that claimed speed. Bad service...I would recommended SANDISK instead. DO NOT BUY THIS..
- I had purchased this SD card before 6 Months, but Now It's not working. Very worst service of samsung. I suggested to all Never but this SD card.
- DON'T BUY WASTE OF MONEY,NOT DETECTING IN MOBILE,CARD READERS ANY WHERE,SO MUCH OF PROBLEMS EVERY TIME.MY SUGGESTION IS GO FOR SOME OTHER BRANDS.
- any time hang over and do not open any file for some time failure shown. so please improve this products.  thanks chainaram suthar
- Very bad product. I've used it only 2 months and now its showing error. I lost all my photos , videos and data's around 21 GB. Hate the product.
- I had a chance to check 2 units of it and this is what l found..... 1st router was good but it came with a noisy adapter! When connected to power it made sound like a fly. Replaced the item with a new one.  2nd router too had the adapter-noise issue along with that it had its own problems like 1) weaker signal strength 2) Page loading issue.  amazon.in,yahoomail etc were not opening. While these pages were loading without any trouble when I connected LAN cable directly to my laptop.  Returned again and waiting for refund :|
- This router has been troublesome since day 1. The wireless connectivity suddenly drops and i need to reset the router to connect again. Used to happen every few times a day. I then packed this & started using my 3 year old tiny Beetel work horse. I kept this away packed meaning to get it repaired. In the past few days again I tried this piece & it still dropped wireless connectivity twice in half a day. This is really poor in terms of quality. And the only reason I had bought this was the higher rating on Amazon. Disappointed.
- Very disappointing.  Worst product with very bad signal strength. Not enough for even 2 bedroom flat. Not sure if the product design is bad or the instrument is bad, but the purpose of buying 300MBPS with 2 antennas is defeated with this product. Even if I come out of room just outside with door closed, there is no signal. If you move away more than 20 Feet there is no signal no connectivity.  I seriously regret buying this product. Please do not buy if you want decent range to the wifi.
- worst product, have purchased it just one month ago. Though initially it was working good but suddenly it stopped to receive signals. I visited to service center as it was under warranty period. The service personnel received the product and assured to replace it after 15 days. The service person also offer another used  set so as to uninterrupted work until the original was replaced, but unfortunately when I returned home and engaged it to the system the same was not respond at all.
- As if it isn't disappointing enough to receive this cheap plastic piece of junk after freaking twenty Five days, this scrape box stopped working the second day!!! Serious Amazon??!!..it is probably my mistake to presume that USA e-store giant would keep up its integrity and credibility in India as well. A word of advice, select your dealers with caution if you intend to woo your users. The star is just for the decent customer care hotline you guys have, unlike the junk that you sell.
- This modem is cheap - YES, but it gives a lot of problems.  1st Purchase was useless since wifi was NOT working.  In my stupidity I thought lets try again. The replacement received on 31 AUG 2015 worked for around 12 days till 12 SEP 2015.  After that stopped working completely.  Am VERY UNHAPPY since the return window is 10 days & my money is down the drain on this.  Have been ROYALLY Cheated.  Picking up D-Link.
- The worst product EVER!!!! When this product came, it had a really good range and speed and now it's been only 2 months, the range and speed BOTH have dropped to a very serious extent!!! I didn't expect such low quality since TP- LINK has a good name.....but I personally would NOT RECOMMENDED this product to anyone at all!!!!  Really a disappointment from Amazon and tp link
- Although this works ok for occasional emails/browsing -- I found speed and quality of connection get dropped while using vpn/continuosly -- as compared to dlink dir 605 which i used earlier -- in which connection quality was fantastic and never dropped and could download movies even with net download speeds of 20/32 kbps . Am disappointed with quality of connection and performance of this box.
- Very poor quality of WiFi Range, I have order it looking at 2 antennas but wifi rage is very poor. I will not suggest to buy this router if you are looking for good WiFi coverage. I am getting very poor coverage out of my 10 X 10 ft room. Think twice before you buy. It not even worth for Rs 1055 which I got on deal. This is cheap quality router... I will suggest to go with other router.
- Was a defective product. My ACT broadband is 20MBPS. This wifi router output was 0.15 MBPS. Now running around with the Painful replacement process. The only TP LINK OFFICE IN CHENNAI does not accept the machine ON SATURDAYS. not sure if they expect every customer to take a week day leave to go submit the machine. Absolutely inconvenient. Poor poor TP LINK SERVICE.
- Poor network coverage.... And power supply makes sound
- Received the product a day late. However the packing was good. But the router failed to configure ... Bad experience with a defected product. Waited so long for it and finally received a faulty product.
- this product is not good.....it is not stable....suddenly it show NO INTERNET ACCESS and SUDDENLY IT PROVIDE ACCESS INTERNET.  TP LINK CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS WORST OF ALL  SUPPORT CENTER, I CALLED 25 TIMES WITH 19 HOURS ON HOLD WITHIN 3 DAYS....BUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEAK TO ANYONE AND THEY SAY WE WILL CALL BACK AND AFTER LINE IS DISCONNECTED.  I CALLED Sales phone:  +91 9768012285 WHICH I GOT FROM SITE....MR.RAMAKATH ANSWERED THE PHONE, EXPLAIN THE ISSUE...HE WAS RUDE TO ME AS IF HE IS DOING SOME MEHERBANI....  I HAD PURCHASED DLINK/IBALL/NETGEAR AND EXPERIENCE WAS GOOD COMPARE TO TP-LINK.  PLEASE DONOT BUY TPLINK FROM ANYONLINE WEBSITE....  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE AND UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE
- Guys this work grt at the first. But if try reset this router it would allow you to log in the router page. so make sure u do this test with in return period  or wht u have there is a peice of junk....
- I received the item on 27/07/2015 and just connected it today dated 02/08/2015. But it is not communicating at all. Even i had shown to my engineer. but it is not working. i want to replace it.
- Wifi is not working on laptops(multiple laptops) with this router. Working fine on mobiles though. Upgraded my firmware but still same issue. 5 stars for Amazon for its deal and timely delivery.
- The tp link which i got that device is faulty. This device is not in working condition. Due to the terms and condition i am not able to return it. So it is totally waste of money dealing for me.
- The wifi signal drops and keeps giving request timed out after every 10-15 hops even though you stand next to the router.  Not a good experience with TPLINK.  Better go for Netgear or DLINK
- Please dont buy this specific router if you dont have a modem. This router comes without modem. I assumed that every wifi router will have in built modem and wasted my money buying this.
- This I bought as I read good review about its good range n good signal. But after few days it's range started to diminish. I found this only as good as dlink single antenna router.
- I am very much disappointed with the performance of bought product as the TP Link Router is not suitable to Sign In to Yahoo.Com which is confirmed by trouble shooter of computer.  Please replace it since I need Sign In to Yahoo Mail regularly.
- I had to reset the router  as am  getting error  &#34;Page cannot be displayed &#34; .Internet Explorer found the problem with router connectivity issues and suggested to reset the router , this is a brand new router but still had to reset it.
- Don't buy it.. I used it for 7 days..Signal strength varies widely & sometimes there's signal loss for 2-3 hours. I installed it in the ground floor. Even on 1st floor ( &#60; 30 meters) the signal weakens. Waste of money. Refunded item.
- Not upto mark... doest provide wifi range from hall to bedroom...
- Worst quality continues disconnection problem and amazon provide only 10 days replacement guarantee. I am facing this problem after 15-20 days after buy, so can't do anything. But this kind of quality never expecting from you Amazon
- This router has poor range and keeps dropping signal as well. Even sitting within 5 feet of it I didn't have full signal. I have returned it and gone back to my 5 year old Netgear router which has much better coverage than this.
- Not a good product.. Took days to set it up and also the internet gets disconnected on its own but the wifi stays on. If i plug my LAN to my pc everything works fine but dont understand y the Internet gets disconnected on WiFi.
- I purchased this product solely based on online reviews for TP-Link routers in general.  I made the mistake of not reading through the TP-Link forums for this particular product and ended up wasting some time.  My Internet connection has a static IP address assigned by my ISP.  I had been using a Belkin router on this connection for the past 5 years, which went bust for some reason a few weeks back.  I ordered this TP-Link router as a replacement.  After adding the connection settings to the router, it connected to the ISP's server within the first 30 seconds.  The connection was smooth initially but after about 2 minutes, the connectivity simply dropped.  I could not resolve any domain name or even ping my ISP's server.  After a lot of trial and error I rebooted the router and the connectivity was restored.  The connection remained stable for another 30 seconds and then disappeared again.  Several reboots later I observed that the connection remained stable for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time.  I called up my ISP and asked them to bring their own router along.  The ISP's technician came, configured his own router and the connection worked fine for 30 minutes.  Re-connecting the TP-Link router led us back to the dropped-connections issue.  We re-connected the technician's router and surfed TP-Link forums for posts on this particular router, finding a number of posts from users facing exactly the same issue with all types of connections (not just static IP address) with all firmware versions starting from v6 to the current v10.  No one had been able to resolve the problem other than by installing a custom firmware.  Disappointed, I returned the item.  Credit to Amazon for taking the return without asking any questions.  The charged amount was also refunded to me within a week's time.  Overall, a very unreliable device and no resolution if one happens to get stuck with a bad piece.
- hell with u amazon.i have been waiting for long so that u pick up ur defected item... bt there was no pickup as well as no replacement.. what m i going to do with this defected router? give me a solution as early as possible
- This is not working properly it is not good product I completely setup but it is not provide lone range even  i use so near but it is not working properly...i think not don't buy pls i want to give back pls return money...
- Thired class product. I had to replace it two times. And I have to replace it from tp link and not from amazon. I have no service station at my town so I had to send it to tp link house at mumbai on my own courier charge.
- modem was god but the usage is low the data is becoming low while using modem throuugh wifi and but I returned to seller because of data trouble and but seller didn't give any refund of Rs1299 till the date on 25/11/2014
- The signal keeps dropping atleast 4-5 times in a day which is just unacceptable. I had hoped that its going to be a good router but its been just a disappointment and I am thinking of buying another one to replace this.
- Specs show VERSION 8 but I received VERSION 9(this was important as I had a specific requirement). You cannot mess up with the specs, not cool Amazon. Otherwise the product should be quite okay, didn't use it.
- After every 30 minutes it is getting disconnected. I need to switch it off and on it. I suggest not to buy this item. I will be replacing it due to the defected product.  Amazons service is excellent.
- The range is not enough capable ... Not even satisfied with the speed ... I am having one more d link route one antena that is too good compare to this one ... I want to replace it or i want my money back ...
- First time product was not working so i get it replaced. But the second time it worked for 1 Month and started giving problems.  So not at all happy with the this product. Its Manufacturer's fault.
- Its not working.;.....for 3days it was ok but after dat.. .its not working at all. I tried To call costumer care and want to return it but I cant...plz this product s not working tell me how can I return it
- very bad experience. my 2 BHK apartment in not even useful. router coverage area is very low even not connect to in next room. same product in my office there so courage area minimum 2 floor.
- Service of Amazon is excellent. Unfortunately, product is not that good. I would suggest to buy standard router from reputed brands like Linksys, Dell etc. These chinese products really does not do the job.
- I bought this router recently thinking that it would support 60Mbps speed provided by ACT Fibernet. But to my disappointment, speed of wireless internet using this router was 20Mbps(tested by speedtest.net) though I was getting ~60Mbps when laptop is directly connected to the cable.
- No service support from TP Link. Especially in kerala only one service center at cochin .Even if it has three year warranty,for replacement we have to courier product the to Mumbai office and courier charge is paid paid by us (Rs 150 in professional courier).Better to avoid buying this.
- The product worked fine in the first month of use. But now it started acting weird. It connects to internet for 2 minutes and the disconnects(I will have to restart the router again to connect). And I also heard about dd-wrt firmware but I think I should go for the warranty.
- Poor quality product supplied.MTNL wifi router of my neighbour is far better than this. Very weak signal in another room and is lost in another.Cannot give coverage even to a 2 bhk flat of mine. Frequent disconnectivity is also there.Asked for replacement.
- this router is not good, i bought after reading the review from other customer, i am not getting the consistent speed with this, after few hours speed will be very less, i can check the good speed with the cable directly but this router will give very less speed.
- I'm very unhappy with my purchase, there router disconnect regular on it's own, at first I thought that the is some problem with my service provider but then I used another router from a friend and it worked fine, it would be great if you'll can replace this.
- Network signal is just 1 bar at 10 feet and once moved beyond 10Ft its completely dead I was busy all these days and missed return option now I am not sure where to contact or no instructions given Given 1 star for sending defective product
- Worst moden ever, my Beling N150 give 3 times its range.  Pros: Looks good and low cost to get double anttenna. Sufficient Speed.  Cons: 5DBI antenna- but never give the range of my complete house hall. Service is tough to find.
- Router stopped working after 10 days. There are no service centers and their phone and email support isn't upto mark.They are asking for log and I can't access the router as it stopped working.  Go for D link, which has door pickup for replacement.
- using since 2 weeks, not upto expected signal drops every 30-40s very low range i do not advise to buy please increase your budget and take non tplink wireless  if any of you have a soln for signal drop please share
- 90% of TP-Link product are defective, i too had a defective router , i went to replace it at main service center at Vasai(mumbai). they gave me replacement from Buffer stock ( they repair the defective piece and give it as replacement, not the same one that v submit ). replaced router is also defective. we should take tp-link company to court.
- Streaming of Videos is just bad also the overall wifi speed is less,  i was getting better speed over my Old N150 Belkin router.  Adding to it there's no customer service for this thing i had an issue of not being able to create password for WiFi i tried contacting TP customer care like for 2 hrs and there's no response.  Pathetic experience.
- Is it really 300mbps...i dnt think so... Its transmission seems to be too bad... Earlier i had 54mbps which used to transmit signal better thn this..net connection remains same n now this router doesnt evwn give signal to single device... Seems to be something wrong with device..may return within return policy...
- Product have range problem- in 2 BKH flat in mumbai - if this routhwr  is install in enteance hall then fine ,but in side your Room - this product is fail- no network- AMAZONE sld stop selling TP LINK BRAND  product immedialty on their webside-platform- OTHERWISE it will impact AMAZONE BRAND-ty r seeling faulty product
- The router was working fine for a month, after which it stopped working suddenly. I couldnt connect to the internet. My internet service provider told me that the router had a problem, and proved it by connecting his own router. Bad product, and not recommended. I am not sure about the warranty either/
- Absolute useless product..! Range might be good.. But the connectivity sucks big time. Constant connection drops, inconsistent wifi connectivity is the biggest issue with this TP Link router. Better invest some more and get a good router, may be D Link or Netgear or Asus for that matter. Avoid this product.
- Not upto the mark. Though it is a double antenna router at a little distance its signal is getting weak or it is unable to connect. And even in front of the router it is unable to get full signal. Tried to replace the router but i was unable to do so. Sometimes I ponder they are selling defected items.
- Bought this based on all reviews here and have been burnt. Not literally, but figuratively. The signal keeps dropping like there's a wavelength issue. Every time we switch back to our old router everything is great. But when we put this back on same problem. So have had to discard it. Waste of money.
- I had purchase in sep2014 and also get port error means MAC ID not showing in system in few month but this time,  past 4-5 days not showing MAC ID to my ISP provider, & he said to me &#34;your Router MAC ID Not showing on my system for reset MAC ID&#34;, I have to get very bad Experience from TP-LINK
- The installation was quite difficult as the web link for installation does not work, so difficulty in setting up with wifi connectivity, had to plug in a lan cable and then allow my pc to detect it and then install...if TP link cannot even run a website properly, whey are they selling routers????
- The signal strength is very weak. If i try to use it from different room it doesn't work. Even in the same room within a distance of 10 feet signal is so weak, I was forced to dump it & look for a better one. Would recommend not to buy unless you will be using within 4-5 feet of the router & that too with clear line of sight.
- Awfull experience. Device is not working as a wifi hotspot
- Useless, the software doesnt work and computer does not detect the adapter. this product is too s***ty . dont buy this

- Mouse is lagging ..
- I had purchased it but not good to me. I want to give it back. Please get it back. thanks.
- The bad product
- This is the worst keyboard+mouse combo ever. I bought it after looking at the company and the image provided, which are very misleading, as the keyboard is very tiny and there is no bezel, so its very easy for someone to press keys accidentally, while picking it up.  Another thing is that the receiver is very bad,  sometimes there is huge delay in key pressing and the range is also very bad. It does not works beyond 2 fts.
- Packaging was very poor as if all the items were just randomly stuffed in a box. Mouse was completely defective, i cudnt even insert the batteries in it..  Keyboard too was poor,  the &#34;delete&#34; key was hanging from the keyboard and i had to replace it manually.. Quality of keys seems very cheap and its difficult for typing purpose.. I placed it for refund the very next day i recieved it...
- Not Happy. :(
- good product.
- This is not at good designed product from Logitech. It's compact as they have used first row of the key of half size. The battery contain is too loose. I guess, at amazon comes ONLY THOSE products which don't run in Market. Not at all good deal.
- Good service from Amazone but useless product if you expect any serious work from it.Because of the compact form,keys are narrow and congested which affects typing speed.There is no Caps or Tab turn in light...so you will have to check it on screen.

- The numbering keys are not working properly, i want to replace this item please help me about this.
- The size of the item was not exactly the same as it was shown in the picture. Too small to handle .
- Stopped working in less than 2 months (Average daily use). The clicks started malfunctioning in a week from receiving the product. Go for microsoft instead.
- I thought the brand of Dell associated with computer accessory would mean at least a reasonable quality. Sorry - not satisfied at all.
- This product is very bad the look of the product is very good but i got this product i used since 2 days the scroll broked inside and the quality of scroll is very bad it is the important roll of an mouse to scroll...
- Today i received product, and i saw on that MRP as : 299 but you showing as 599, please do not mislead with wrong price.
- Mouse does not work properly. Item was received in good condition as described. but it turned out to be faulty.
- Scrolling key got damaged within 1 month.Wire had some holes at the middle portion which was un-noticeable.
- This product is duplicate of Original Dell mouse. Mouse doesn't work properly on study table. So don't go with this seller product. I had purchased Dell mouse from local authorized dealer and it is working excellent. Delighted by excellent delivery service of Amazon.
- not a good product in just 3 months right button was not responding waste of money
- Too bad scroll button. click buttons working like pressed scroll button.
- Its duplicate item. No one can criticise if they not use original one..
- an mismatch order
- one year warranty
- 5. Click Select
- Got duplicates.
- It has been barely 25 days and the scroll is not working. I can middle click very well but the scroll wheel isn't working anymore. I don't know who to approach for warranty purposes because on Dell website it is stated that no warranty if bought from amazon.in.  Amazon is really sucky these days since I ordered for a car charger and got a cosmetic bag instead. Very poor service and claim filed isn't upto the mark.
- Duplicate.
- it is good
- Its the worst optical mouse ever used...not working without mouse pad..even with the use of mouse pad..the mouse movement is not perfect...buttons are not smooth enough to operate. .really disappointed with this kind of quality from Dell...won't recommend at all....
- not good
- very bad
- Not good
- A very bad product. Often gets disconnected while working. You need to unplug and plug again to get it working. The buttons were getting stuck. Not worth.
- Dell could have made it more better .Below my expectations.Keys are not soft which is the main problem.and also not much accurate.
- The mouse didn't worked. I returned it back which costed me Rs. 170. They refunded only Rs. 100. It was a total loss.
- Scroll button not rotating property
- Worst design and scroller is a hell
- Didnot receive the product at all.
- it doesnot meet my expectation
- not working properly dont use
- got damaged within 2 months
- I didn't like the product
- not working properly...
- I bought this product from Flipkart. I got this product delivered on 17 July 13:00 hours & writing this review on 18 July 11:45 hours i.e. not even 24 hours have passed. In this time, it has started showing several problems. The mouse is extremely disgusting. The cursor on my PC screen moves alone here & there even if none touches it. You cant watch a video or movie peacefully when the cursor moves alone here & there on your PC screen. Also the roller is irritating. It stops working sometimes & after sometimes it again works. Less than 24 hours have passed and it has brought me level of irritation. I suggest everyone not to buy it. It deserves 0.5 star, but there is no option of rating it 0.5 star, that's why I have given 1 star.
- I wanted to give 0 stars review, but the system asks me to fill atleast 1 star.  The dell mouse which I have received, worked for the first time we connected to the computer. Further, it did not work. I have sent the same review to the seller.  The seller asked me to return the product by courier.  Does it mean that I have to spend a few bucks to reach the courier centre and spend so more money on the courier charges, with a total expenditure coming close to Rs. 150 to get my mouse replaced which costed me Rs. 250?  Instead, I can purchase another mouse.  Thank you.
- Product is bad, not working properly within four months of purchase.
- Third class material. Chinese, may be fake dell mouse.
- received a faulty device but loved amazon refund sevice

- after 2 days is damage, not working,.
