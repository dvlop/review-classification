It worked fine for the first 2 months, but now its not reading in most of the USB devices. I'm very unhappy with this product and I recommend you not to buy this or any steel body Pen Drives as they tend to have some or the other issues within 3 months or so. I purchased it on 27th Jan 2015 and the return date is till 03rd Feb 2015, which holds no good for me :("
