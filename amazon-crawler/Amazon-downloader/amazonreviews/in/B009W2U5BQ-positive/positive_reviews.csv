I am writing this review as his memorial and a way to thank him for his valuable service.<br />A Good product. Comfortable to use, feels solid. One I purchased stopped functioning in just 7 months, that doesn't mean this product is not durable, the main reason is it fell so many times from my hand, from table and sometime I got over excited while playing online games.<br /><br />Coincidently, we have the same mouse in our office and we are using these for almost 2 years now, still works. So if you are not a rough user like mine, it may last for years."

The keys have a good feel, the overall size is neither too small nor too large and that shape is designed so that it comfortably supports your palm.  The operation is also very smooth and there are no issues so far.  I have been using this with CAD applications wherein I am continuously making use of it an owing to its ergonomics, it has improved the ease of operation.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!"

I needed a mouse at home where the wireless mouses are failing every one year and eating batteries.

Plug n Play i.e. your OS detects automatically. Online driver download/ manual installation not required.<br />3. Left & Right buttons with entire palm surface is made a bit rough providing better grip + Scrolling is quiet while L/R buttons are clicky.<br />4. Size fits for most unless you are a giant.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Scroll button wobbles a bit. Not an issue if you are careful.<br />2. Not for hardcore gamers/ users who mashes buttons a lot.<br />3. Plastic feels cheap."
