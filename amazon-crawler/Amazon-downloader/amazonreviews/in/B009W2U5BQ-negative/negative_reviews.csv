I got this product delivered on 17 July 13:00 hours & writing this review on 18 July 11:45 hours i.e. not even 24 hours have passed. In this time, it has started showing several problems. The mouse is extremely disgusting. The cursor on my PC screen moves alone here & there even if none touches it. You cant watch a video or movie peacefully when the cursor moves alone here & there on your PC screen. Also the roller is irritating. It stops working sometimes & after sometimes it again works. Less than 24 hours have passed and it has brought me level of irritation. I suggest everyone not to buy it. It deserves 0.5 star, but there is no option of rating it 0.5 star, that's why I have given 1 star."
