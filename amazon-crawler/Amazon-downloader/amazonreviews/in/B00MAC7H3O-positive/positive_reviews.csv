I have it on 24x7 for the last 3 weeks, and no problems at all so far. It's also wonderfully tiny, with an extra bright blue LED; bright enough to check your device is on!<br />A word of caution: it does not work out of the box for the Raspberry Pi (Raspbian), and one has to hunt on the net for drivers, and instructions on how to install them. I guess this is because its V2.0, the earlier V1.0 worked right away."
