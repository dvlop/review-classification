According to A1 SD Bench it gives 27 MB read speed and 17.5 MB write speed inside my phone. Which is more than enough. This card is built to withstand elements. If you want exceptional performance,like faster gallery loading times, look at Samsung PRO line up, as they offer excellent Value for Money.<br /><br />Also i might add a note to genuine or not issue posted by many reviewers. As it turns out that you cant register a Micro SD card in Samsung website, you can register TV, smart phone etc. New Samsung EVO cards doesn't have the arrows and you can check if the card is genuine by checking its transfer speeds. Also the sides of genuine card will be white and the fake ones will be black. Genuine cards are made in Philippines also.<br /><br />Last but not least, i too have purchased the card depicted here by many as fake ( The graphics without arrow and white writings instead of grey ) but when i ran benchmarks with that i got exactly the advertised speed by Samsung, Write 12 Mbps and Read 40 Mbps.At least if they are fake,they perform as good as the Genuine ones. Hope this helps"

They get corrupted and you can't claim a warranty on the product as there are many issues related to it. Inspite of having the bill and box, they say that the product is a duplicate one.<br />So I decided to go for bigger brands. Over all I found SanDisk (memory cards and pen drives) and Samsung memory cards to be very good and quite reliable when compared to kingston and transcend.<br />I gave it 4 stars because strotinum memory cards have a faster speed."

You can use it in low budget digi cams, which will be usuable if you have an adapter and it will give you HD images, recordings hassle free.

Transfer Speeds depend on the file types so there isn't a stable speed which we can fix on and besides that if your avid gamer and you have your game related files stored on SD card or you love watching HD videos this card does just the thing but I prefer pro series cards for them cause they are just designed to give high performance and transfer rates."

Also bottom part of the orange should be light in color and not a reddish orange. The orange should runs to the sides of the card and white color should be coated over that. Also, the make should be Korea.<br /><br />All Taiwan made are fake Samsung cards and orange color is reddish orange. inquire with the seller before make a purchase.
