Just no words.......","The router TL-WR841N from TP-Link is just an awesome piece of technology at cheapest rate one can imagine. There are a no. of 300N Wifi routers but compared to the price and reliability it is a winner. I've been using it for the past 3 months and the following are my findings about the router:<br /><br />Pros:-<br />- Good looking & compact router.<br />- Super easy to set up.<br />- Web based utility does a good job in controlling the router.<br />- All required instructions for easy setup are provided.<br />- The Stock firmware has a lot to offer.<br />- DD WRT firmware support (Just Google 'DD WRT' for details). However, I was unable to use the feature as DD WRT firmware for V9 is not available. Also it voids warranty.<br />- Physical Power AND Wi-Fi switch present. Which means you can switch off your WIFI alone while letting the router run and manage physical LAN connection.<br />- 4 LAN ports present.<br />- It can also be used as range extender.<br />- Has 2 non-detachable antennas for boosting Wi-Fi. I've installed the router in 1st floor and get 1-2 bars in ground & 2nd floor and just outside on the road. Also my tab shows 1 bar while on the roof top of my 3 storey building. So, its coverage is good to average. Data/Internet speed has little effect on the available no. of bars.<br />- It can share loads of data via Wi-Fi & LAN network. I had successfully converted my tab into Wi-Fi virtual keyboard, mouse & gamepad/joystick.<br />- Wall mounting can also be done.<br />- 3 Years Replacement Warrenty.<br /><br />Cons:-<br />-Well as such no serious problems have been faced till date. My only concern is its white colour which looks great but is likely to get dirty sooner or later.<br />- Unnecessary heating problem can be avoided by installing it in an open space.<br /><br />Overall it is the cheapest router available in the market at present with loads of feature on offer. It is highly recommended for those who want cheap router with reliability, security & loads of features.<br /><br />UPDATE (1/11/15) :-<br />The router has been working flawlessly for a year and a half now. However, I had to go for replacement twice due to no fault of mine but Act of GOD. The service of TP-Link is great. They replaced my router after testing then and there with no question asked. Though I had to carry it to there service center. Also, I can see the price has come down to half (by '600-'700). Hope this update will help in further decision making."

Configuration was really hassle free as always.<br /><br />Though after installing, I was a little bit disappointed with the WiFi range. While I am using two TP-Link Modem cum Routers on my two storied home and some of my friends also use this router but they get a very good range but especially this router lacks a good wifi range. I thought this TP-Link comes with 5 DBi Dual Antenna  but what I saw, I think particularly this one maybe came with 3 DBi dual Antenna...And the Wi-Fi signal is fluctuating too much within the same floor and farthest corner is missing signal too. While my TP-Link router covers the whole ground floor as well as there a low but still some sort of range remains available.<br /><br />So somehow, the 3DBi antenna is causing a good range of Wifi and in my opinion, this is really a very good limitation of this Router which I didn't like this time."

It's a great router, the set up is easy so any layman can do it, not that I am one when it comes to tech.<br />There are no signal drops & the wired connection is fast. I have a home network for which it works perfectly, this means I can view movies that are on my PC from another PC connected to the home network [streaming from 1 PC to another or multiple PC's visa-versa] and this is all over the WiFi not wired. There is no buffering involved, for people who don't understand this, the movie files would play just as if it was on your computer but it is not. The WiFi connection is good & it has good range even with obstacles in between, I am saying this having placed this router in one of the worst places in the house, where it is currently.<br /><br />Review is based on Price related to -<br />Build Quality - 95%<br />WiFi Signal Quality/Range - 95%<br />Connection Speed Wired/WiFi - 95%<br />I give it 4 stars because there is always something better.<br /><br />I also game on the Xbox One & 360, so for gaming this router is good as well, but as always the internet is pathetic in this country [India], so unless you have a corporate connection, you will have to deal with the drawbacks of a personal home connection, mine being Airtel broadband.

In my 2 BHK house, it works perfect when I am near the router and it performs fairly well in balconies or extreme corners.<br /><br />But the 3 rating is for the minor glitches I faced for the order. For the first time, I wanted to get the order through COD with express delivery. Although I was prepared with cash, the delivery guy had a machine for swiping debit card, felt glad. But sadly, that didn't work due to some issues. Please fix that if possible.<br /><br />Also, after placing the order I had to change the contact number for getting calls from delivery guy as my old number (which is given in my profile) was suddenly not getting proper signals in my office. So, I tried to contact them on a Friday night and they picked up the call, noted down the new number & informed me that the delivery boys would call me up on my new number.

Another method  to use it as a repeater is to flash DD-WRT firmware which is available nd it also unlocks a vareity of other features but remember it voids warranty.<br />(note: WDS bridging limits bandwidth of router according to base router's so if its bridged with 150mbps router you get only that)<br /><br />UI : simple UI with standard options and features that you could find in any router in the range, and TP link provides an android app -  TP Link tether -  which enables basic control of router from android device like managing connected clients.<br /><br />The one thing i could complain is its white color, which looks actually good now but since routers are bound to be spending most of its life in a corner or on walls and eating dust the white would soon turn into something else."

Yes WIFI switch means you can switch off your WIFI alone while letting the router run and manage physical Lan connection. two stars for that.<br /><br />Cons -<br />- Contrary to the first point as given in the pros. I haven't really seen any great improvement with wireless coverage.<br />That being said, i'm quite disappointed because I was expecting this router to have real good coverage. And to be honest, I'm saying no improvement over the Belkin wireless G router(A entry level router).<br />- The notification lights are cumbersome, I need to get my face all the way right on top of it to coordinate the light indicator with its corresponding indicator(Wifi, Lan or wtr)<br /><br />To Conclude<br />This router, yes its cheaper than what you can find for most of the other N 300 rated routers which come from companies like Belkin and of its sort. It's got that nice specification chart, which will matter only to where it counts.<br />The Wifi range was a total put off for me, and its other specification related stuff could be considered as &#34;future proofing&#34; (in case you're planning to have alot of devices connected to it someday.)<br />This router, will be a winner for you especially if you have a lot of devices connected to it, sharing loads of data within the network. We're talking of something in the range above 200 Mb/s. Or even if you're a gamer and you like to have your friends over to have a Co op among-st yourselves, it will comfortably take the task without any glitch's because its got such a wide bandwidth.<br /><br />As this router, in my experience doesn't give any significant boost of any kind with respect to the WIFI coverage. I didnt have to transfer huge lumps of data within my local network. This router was not for me. (I expected it to have a good wifi coverage)<br />And if you fall in the same criteria, I can as sure as hell tell you that you'd be fine with the N 150.<br /><br />But yes, if you have a lot of devices(Printers, Consoles, PC, smartphones etc) which will be connected and will require to both use the internet and simultaneously share loads of data within your home network. This will do you good. Especially for the price."

This device brags 5Dbi antennas in the specifications. So, I expected a better signal coverage. In fact the signal coverage was just as a normal single 3Dbi antenna. However, the signal bandwidth exceeded my expectations .You can connect many devices simultaneously and exchange tons of data without any issues. I was able to transfer 300GB of data from my desktop to Notebook in just 2 hours and still the device was cool and doesn't show any signs of overheating. In fact, the data transfer (300GB) should take 20-30 minutes if it was transferred at full bandwidth of the router. But, the maximum bandwidth of my PC was 100Mbps (It's a bit outdated). So you can essentially transfer data between another two pairs of devices at 100Mbps if you want to consume full bandwidth of the router.<br />  This device is perfectly suitable for people who want to connect multiple devices to the router and use them for heavy bandwidth applications like Gaming and file transfer. If you are looking for a better device, you can go with TP-LINK TD-W8961ND Verision 2+ (Latest). This device is slightly expensive than TP-LINK TL-WR841N, but,  TD-W8961ND is modem cum router and also comes with detachable antennas. So, if future you can upgrade the antennas for better signal coverage. TP-LINK TL-WR841N comes with fixed antennas.

Good deal @ 900ing","Been using this router for over 3 months and let me assure you, it is a steal for the price they offer. At 900 if u can get a double antenna, upto 300 mbps, N-band router that provides good coverage and an overall decent amount of stability and durability, what more can u ask for?<br />My house is approx 550sqft and the range stays at 5bars constantly. I've known of a couple of my friends having the same router and they stay in bigger 2 and 3-bhks. Still the signal never drops below 3 or 4 bars. That's pretty good at this price if u ask me. Barely 5-6 signal drops in all in these few months of use. I can live with that. Amazon delivery was speedy as usual. Received it in less than 2 days even on normal delivery. Which was one day before the estimated delivery date. Keep it up Amazon."

The range is excellent for a router at this price range compared to its counter parts from other brands.<br />2. It provides you the feature of WDS bridging which the other routers do not provide. (Although you can attain it in other routers finding some indirect long ways)<br />3. Provides you remote management of your router. Since I have static ip, it's extremely useful for me. (You can attain it by forwarding ports in other routers too but it has a direct feature).<br />4. Assurance of the brand TP Link.<br />5.

Only thing I figured out is the range of wifi signal coverage with this router is lesser, though this has two antennas. My previous DLink wireless router which I was using for more than 7 years, was having single antenna and it could cover good range of 20 meters across multiple concrete floors and through cemented walls, but here with TP-LINK TL-WR841N, the signal reception when compared to DLink does not come near. In my apartment I don't get signals if I step away for more than 10 meters - with hardly a wall in between.<br />Using Linux, connecting to wifi worked like a charm. As internet speeds gets better and better, with some providers providing more than 60Mbps, older routers won't adapt to the internet providers speed. Buying a 300Mbps would be futuristic. Certainly this product is worth for money."

However, when I connected it to my network, the wifi did not work. The devices would connect, but cannot browse. The issue has been reported in many sites. So, I packed it back to return. But I wanted to give it a last try.<br /><br />My set up includes an Apple Timecapsule at the primary router that connects to my ACT Fibernet 60mbps network. It gets a 192.168.0.1 ip address. Unfortunately the same IP is used by this router too, but with a twist. It changes to 192.168.1.1 if it detects a gateway. With this auto config, things seemed to fail. I changed the IP to 192.168.2.1 and I could successfully get connected to the internet. Ideally I would have a loved a bridge mode that does a piggy back to the other routers. There is no such option in this. I got version 9 of the hardware and according to many it does not support DD-WRT firmware."

For the starters it is a bang for the buck, for less than a 1000 Rupees it gives you a dual antenna, and the range is good too! However the prices is reflected in the build quality, which is not bad but does feel cheap! The plastic used is not as premium and also the antennas are loosely connected and not as sturdy as they should be! But its a router and creating a WLAN is what it does great! The setup is super easy and it also gives you advanced manual setup options, and full access to control the device and all the required options! Also comes with a LAN cable that is long enough! I use it with 4-5 devices and it doesn't get strained and functions as smooth as it should, and I get a speed of around 25 Mbps over the WLAN which is same as a direct LAN connection!

Kudos to the seller! But as typical in an online purchase, the warranty card with the date of purchase sealed was not included.<br /><br />Coming to the device... it's been just a few days I have started using the device and I haven't faced any issues. Indeed not supposed to because it's too early. Regarding the range and signal strength, I find it excellent inside my 1500 sq.ft. 3BHK flat.<br /><br />The setup was also a breeze. But for my internet connection through cable, I have to change the WAN connection type to PPPoE from the default set Dynamic IP, which in fact was easy to do. You have to just select &#34;PPPoE&#34; for the field &#34;WAN Connection Type&#34; present under Network &#62; WAN page and enter your username and password. After configuring the values, it's very convenient to work in WIFI mode and you won't be prompted to enter your username and password every time.<br /><br />As suggestions to the manufacturer, they can support their default automatic setup for cable internet connection as well. By this way, non tech savvy users will find it easy to configure or else they have to depend with their ISP people or seek elsewhere. Also, they can focus on the hardware's aesthetics along the lines of minimalistic principles. Cisco's base Linksys' models are worth emulating."

At some locations, router configuration page would not open even when there is single bar range. At times my laptop is unable to connect to router but other devices could connect.

At some point of time advance features like, bandwidth control, WDS bridging or access rules would surely help.<br /><br />Overall, dont fall for all the jazz words like 5 dbi antennas, dual antennas etc This may not be upgrade to your good ol router, so choose ONLY IF your old router has stopped working."

I found the WIFI speed is only a 0.5 mbps weaker that the DSL speed if connected from a close range.<br /><br />One point of note is this not a ADSL router,so if you are connected through a telephone(MTNL,BSNL) line therefore using a modem you might consider models which have in-built modem so you dont need a separate modem to connect.If you are getting a direct digital signal(DSL) from your local provider this router is the right choice to set up your WIFI network.<br /><br />Setting up the router is not difficult at all if the right steps are followed which ironically not available in the installation manual.<br />If you happen to connect to internet by an authentication step though your providers log-in screen the router needs to be configured first .You can do it by following the steps bellow....<br />1 : Type 192.168.0.1 on your web browser address bar<br />2 : Once the router configuration screen appears click on &#34;Quick Setup&#34;<br />3 : Go to IP address config section in the mobile device/laptop/desktop pc and note down the IP,Subnet Mask and DNS address<br />4 : Delete the details noted in the previous step and switch to dynamic mode from your browsing device.<br />5 : On the Easy setup wizard provide the same details noted in step 3<br />6 : Provide a name/password for your wifi in the appropriate wizard screen<br />7 : Restart the router and check to find your wifi network on your browsing device.<br /><br />Although there is a customer support number available on the packet its after many attempts i was able to get through and get some technical support.<br /><br />Overally barring the hassles i faced to setup the router in the absence of complete set-up manual this router seems like a good buy .

Although, that compactness comes with a price you have to pay with an unconventional keyboard layout that isn't exactly so comfortable. But I have already got accustomed to it now, so I can use it without any issues.<br /><br />The key travel seems to have placed somewhere between that of a laptop keyboard and a conventional full-size keyboard. Hence it gives commendable feedback, and is extremely comfortable.<br /><br />But I find the mouse uncomfortable to use. It isn't grippy and isn't that ergonomic. Besides, the scroll wheel button feels too hard.<br />Instead, I have been using the Logitech M185 for the past 6 years, which is undoubtedly one of the best budget wireless mice by logitech.<br /><br />Do check out my full video review here:<br />(...)"

It reminds me of an old advertisement of a bike - complementing its fuel efficiency&#34; fill it, shut it and forget it&#34; same can be told about this product. Plug the dongle and forget it. keyboard and mouse work very nice.<br /><br />Reason for not giving 5 star is as its a wireless keyboard we have to pick it up many a times. Have a close look at the form. there is no extra space on top, right or bottom. So whenever you pick it up from these side few of keys gets pressed which is very annoying. but now I pick it by holding from left side only.<br /><br />If this is not a problem for you I would suggest go and buy this product."

No complaints..<br />Keyboard, the keys are a little crowded especially the arrow keys, and I definitely didn't like the small enter key.. So using it as a desktop keyboard is not advisable, but as a laptop keyboard it worth it doesn't take much space.. It takes one USB for the dongle, which matters on ur usage.. If you know typing, another issue is that the letter F and J is not having a small projection which guide your fingers (I'm not sure of this at the moment, will correct if othwise)<br /><br />I'm using this product for about a month and it's quite OK, saves space of your desk.. I guess we don't use the keyboard much, so should be OK to buy considering the price.. However a bluetooth device (this one is Radio frequency) would increase the compatibility to even ur mobile devices.."

After a lot of searching I finally zeroed on this keyboard mouse combo, firstly because of it'sperfect dimensions (best suited for persons using laptops and wanna carry a wireless keyboard on the go in their backpack) and secondly the most obvious reason that it is of Logitech.<br />I would like to add something here because I think this is something many of you don't know or may not have noticed like me. Logitech International is actually a Swiss Multinational company and not of Taiwan or South Korea as the name may sound like.<br />Build Quality:<br />The build quality is nice especially the keyboard.But I would have preferred a better build of the mouse. The top piece of the mouse doesn't sit firmly and is a little squeaky. You can find this really clearly when you hold the mouse up in air and shake it gently. Even some low cost mouse vendors like Zebronics, iball provide better build mouse than this. The keyboard is well built, not squeky of any sorts but certainly not spill proof. To tell you about the overall size of the keyboard I would tell that is almost the same as the size of a laptop (ie. of a 14-15.6 inch) keypad. I hope you can understand how compact it is.<br />Usability:The keyboard has closely placed keys which might be annoying for some but if you are used to using laptops it won't be an issue. There is also a INR symbol in this keyboard and thats really handy. I must mention that this keyboard has every keys that are present on a normal desktop keyboard even the print screen key(which comes in handy while test ping) inspite of its compact form factor. The keys are quite tactile too. Moreover the keyboard comes with multimedia functionality with all shortcut keys of volume up down, calculator, my computer and so on. You need to press the FN key plus the respective keys (i.e for those multimedia functionality) together. Overall the mouse response is really good. And kudos to the strong range of the wifi you can use this keyboard sitting far away from the computer. Best suited for watching movie and sitting on your bed or sofa while your computer is placed about 10ft away on the table. No issues. Or maybe for slide presentation.<br />Inbox contents:<br />1. Mouse 2. Keyboard 3.Two AAA GP Alkaline battery (mouse) 4.Two AA GP Alkaline Battery.<br />Competitors:<br />1.Microsoft Wireless Desktop Keyboard 800<br />2.Dell Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo KM113<br />But considering the form factor of the Logitech MK220 there at all no competition because the other two are much bigger in size and difficult to carry round. Plus I suggest to go with Logitech as it's a more experienced player in the field of computer accessories than the other two.<br />If you like my review kindly press the like button below to support me to write more reviews like this in future."

Because of small size arrow/navigation keys, it is difficult to play games or scroll webpages.<br />2. As i was busy, i didn't use the keyboad for around 1.5 to 2 months. I forgot about the free batteries inside. They leaked and as circute is right below the batteries, entire circute got damaged.

The reasons why I bought this are:<br /><br />1. Excellent bang for the buck. This is highly affordable both in terms of running costs (price of cartridges) and upfront cost (price of printer) and works well for low volumes of printing.<br /><br />2. Great in terms of features. Wireless, photo printing (not the high end variety), ePrint features, scanner (with send to identified computer on the network feature).<br /><br />3. Convenient size and easy to setup. Was a complete breeze to get it up and running. It can also be located anywhere within the home because of the wireless feature. You needn't have it right next to the comp/ router.<br /><br />There isn't anything I don't like about it yet. But that said, these are still early days.<br /><br />It replaces a 9 year old Canon Pixma printer for me where the cartridges are prohibitively expensive. The price difference for 3 cartridge replacements (black and color) covers the new printer price. So replacement for me was a no-brainer.<br /><br />However, if you are a photo buff and print a lot of your stuff, this isn't your kinda thing. Then you need to look at serious photo printers in a totally different price range."

I installed the driver and software from the supplied CD.<br /><br />This has an in-built wifi network. So in case you do not have a home wifi to print wirelessly, you can connect to the printer wifi (network) and do wireless print. It also does scanning wirelessly. I could easily keep the printer connected to one side of a room where I have power connection, and print from anywhere !!! great, isn;t it ?<br /><br />The only drawback is I could not connect it to my home wifi, so I could not set up cloud printing. Upon investigation, I realised that it can recognize Type-N signal (801.11n), but my home wifi is b/g network since it is a very old BSNL modem/router. However, this isn't a big issue for me as I can always use the printer's wifi to print wirelessly.<br /><br />To add to convenience, it can also do double-side printing, and pdf scanning :-)"

I have a mini laptop with no CD drive,  so I had to download the software from the internet before I could get going - ~100mb. Setup on my android phone was simple with the HP printer app. Print quality is good, but it is not easy to find the duplex setting and draft mode setting. The android app does not seem to have an option to save these as defaults, and I am yet to figure out if this can be directly configured on the printer. I would have wished to see this detail in the instructions or on the HP support portal.

Maybe I am using a higher quality printing option here. Need to check that.<br /><br />Other slight problems I would say are slow printing speed and shaking during printing.

It is economical with its ink and so its ink cartridge lasts for a long time. In fact it still works after many months of usage. So, a few days back, I ordered one for my son as well. I have deducted one star because of HP service. It should charge another Rs 300 and install the printer so that the user becomes fully conversant with its usage. During scan, some times it gives the message of not communicating with the computer but gives no suggestion of how to rectify it. One has to spend lot of time trying to solve the problem. The problem accrues when you buy from Amazon, as a retail dealer agrees to give you demo. Would Amazon do some thing in this respect and liasing with HP make its buyer the same service as any other dealer? I purchased it from Amazon.in so it should have been labelled 'Verified Purchase' but it is not."

I got this memory card samsung Evo 16 GB with 10th grade.This the very slow card to copy or receiving data. I think its very cheap quality product . I did not use this card after ordering because my old mobile phone was not compatible with 16 GB . So when i got my new phone which was supporting 32 GB ,but this memory card works very slowly.

Transfer Speeds depend on the file types so there isn't a stable speed which we can fix on and besides that if your avid gamer and you have your game related files stored on SD card or you love watching HD videos this card does just the thing but I prefer pro series cards for them cause they are just designed to give high performance and transfer rates."

So happy customer.<br /><br />Tips for the new buyers:<br />=======================<br />When you get the product make sure that the sides (width part) of the card are white. Also bottom part of the orange should be light in color and not a reddish orange. The orange should runs to the sides of the card and white color should be coated over that. Also, the make should be Korea.<br /><br />All Taiwan made are fake Samsung cards and orange color is reddish orange. inquire with the seller before make a purchase. I made with seller Uonline.<br /><br />If you get a fake cards, please report to Amazon without fail."
