But due to some delay (package arriving at wrong courier facility), i received it on 7 june morning. Amazon customer service was excellent and very helpful and they tried their best to make this delivery fast. 5*'s for amazon.<br />Now returning to product. I received it in excellent packaging surrounded by airbags. This product has 3 years limited warranty.<br />It's shell is mettalic. Also, its very slim and portable. Easily slides into the pocket. The cable provided with it is of average length. While copying it gives better speed than its competition (both on 2.0 and 3.0). Its only drawback is that it doesn't work with old os like win 98, xp, etc. But i think everyone is using win 7 or 8 these days so it should not trouble anyone. Actual space provided is 931 GB. A seagate dashboard software is included using which u can backup some select folders or ur entire pc. It also powers the user to backup the data on their smartphones. A separate app is available on Play store for android and app store for ios.<br />I highly recommend this product to everyone who is in need of a 1 TB external hard drive."

If we stack 2 Seagate Slim Plus, that much thicker is the WD My Passport Ultra 2TB Portable (NOT WD 1TB model).<br />Compared to an iPhone 5 size, the Seagate drive is a little bit thicker (2-3mm), shorter length wise (1cm) and wider width wise (2cm).<br /><br /># Connectivity:<br />This drive uses a standard blue USB 3.0 cable (included) that is backwards compatible to USB 2.0 meaning that you can plug it into any Mac or PC.<br />And the cable is not much flexible like WD HDD. But it feels premium quality than WD.<br /><br /># Speed:<br />This is result when I compared with Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB, WD Elements 1TB Portable (WDBPCK0010BBK-EESN) & WD My Passport Ultra 1TB Portable.<br />(See the attached picture or use link below)<br />http://s11.postimg.org/mvduokuir/Untitled_13.jpg<br /><br /># MAC Compatibility:<br />There is a Free Paragon NTFS driver on Seagate website. You can run any NTFS storage peripherals when you install this driver.<br /><br /># Free bundled software:<br />The drive includes helpful backup software and a free two-year 200GB subscription to Microsoft OneDrive online storage.<br /><br /># Dislikes:<br />There are NO rubber grip pads under the HDD case. So, it is easy to slip from table/desk & doesn't reduce vibrations (HDD don't have any vibration or noise now).<br />NO rubber pads on 4 corners inside the case of HDD. So, doesn't survive small drops.<br /><br /># Compared to WD:<br />If u want 2TB HDD & exactly what the word &#34;SLIM&#34; means, go for Seagate. For rough use & don't care about slim size, always go for WD.<br />All WD HDD have rubber pads on 4 corners inside the case & rubber grips under the HDD case. It will help to survive small drops & hits, reduce slip from table/desk & reduce vibrations.<br /><br /># WARNING:<br />Remember, this is a electronic product. We can't predict for how many days these HDD will work. Usually, when we get these things we will use very carefully for about 2-3 months, afterwards we use roughly. If you are a rough user & always plug this on computer & share this HDD with friends, most of these won't survive very long even if they belong to the best company in portable HDD or best reviewed one. I suggest, for more secure your data, always upload your important data on one or two reputed Cloud Drives (GoogleDrive, Dropbox, iCloud).<br /><br />  **Please use the Like button if you like this review**"

I use it for Movies, Personal Media and Games.<br /><br />For Better Durability:<br />1. ALWAYS !!! show some patience and Safely Remove USB (Its for your own good).<br />2, Use of a case like SmartFish (http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00GGB912U?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_88) or anything Similar.<br />3. Avoid plugging it in TV, Laptop or Desktop for long hours.<br />4. Transfer movies or series episodes you want to watch into a Pen Drive and watch it, do not directly Plug and Play for the whole run time.<br />5. Instead of laying in down on the floor or suspending it (never do) on a device keep it inside the cover and use it to avoid static shocks.<br />6. Only give the HDD to people who would care it like you will. ( very important )<br /><br />Doing all this will surely help the durability factor and save your precious moments and data from being lost. Trust me i have been following it for a really long time with other Storage Devices."

Glossy plastic enclosures are hard to keep looking good, so kudos to Seagate for using the matte plastic instead. The back of the drive has the USB 3.0 port and there's an itty bitty blue power/activity light on top of the drive, towards the back. Also, there are small rubber feet on the bottom, to keep the drive from sliding around on your desk. The USB 3.0 cable is short, so it's best suited for use with laptops."

Of course, the two are very different in terms of weight and portability.<br /><br />It's pretty much as small as a 2.5-inch hard drive enclosure can be, which makes us wonder how shock-resistant it actually is. My review unit had a metallic red finish on top, which was quite striking. The sides are glossy black, while the bottom is textured for a non-slip grip.<br /><br />Seagate includes a 0.5m USB 3.0 cable. You could easily slip this drive into a pocket and carry it around all day.<br /><br />Software<br /><br />Seagate includes both Mac and PC versions of its Dashboard utility. You have to install a registration utility as well, and you're forced to reboot before you can use any of it and then says it needs to download a 93MB update.<br /><br />Performance<br />Unsurprisingly, the Backup Plus Fast outperformed its smaller sibling by a very wide margin in most tests. Both drives performed well, thanks to the fast USB 3.0 interface. You can expect sequential read and write speeds of around 106Mbps with the Slim, and 230Mbps with the Fast. Random read and write speeds, as measured by SiSoft SANDRA 2014, were more in line, with the Fast at 61.3 and 87.14Mbps as opposed to the Slim at 52.58 and 53.51 respectively.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />  Slim and light<br />  Versatile enough for everyday use<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />  Slightly expensive<br /><br />Ratings (Out of 5)<br /><br />  Design: 4<br />  Performance: 3.5<br />  Value for Money: 3.5<br />  Overall: 3.5"

"53","XX","","5","34","42","on 10 October 2014","ANONYMOUS","Is there any other 12mm Portable drives out there? Read on..","Hello World,<br /><br />I've Seagate Backup Plus slim 2TB two weeks before and thought of giving a video review. And it was not possible. I previously had a Samsung G2 320GB hence am little experienced how these portable drives perform, size factor, etc.<br /><br />I deeply checked all portable drives of storage capacity 2TB and found that, This is the ONLY drive of 12mm. WD Passport is wrongly mentioned of 15mm thickness in amazon.in and even in flipkart.com but Go to WD Site where it is specifically mentioned that 2TB version is of 20mm. All Adata, Samsung M3, etc. are of 20mm. I wanted a slimmest one hence went for this. Also I watched a Case opening video and found that, this drive had Internal SATA-USB Conversion and hence if drive goes bad, data recovery is possible through SATA Port. Surf YouTube for that info,<br /><br />MRP Mentioned on package is ₹13990. On my purchase from 'Infiniti Retail Ltd' seller in amazon.in, After SBI Card 10% discount, it costed ₹6883.2 where in USA selling at $100, I had to give ₹883 for country variation!  Shipped from Mumbai on a Saturday and got product to Tamilnadu on Monday, with FedEx (amazon.in and FedEx rock!)<br /><br />After I ordered the product, I felt bad as price is very dynamic. Price went down for nearly ₹50 for which I was able to able refund request. Instead crediting money back to Card, Folks at amazon.in sent me Cheque! And it’s of some Deutsche Bank where I don't have account hence to redeem that money, I have to spend more! (Due to Cheque collection fee from other bank!), (Cheque is collecting Dust ;-)). Then, after 10 days price fall was drastic to approx. ₹7200 where I was safe only due to SBI Card Cash back<br /><br />Package was Good (Seagate logo engraved is Superb cool!) and Drive as expected as thin (I felt thinner than my previous G2!) My Desktop just has USB 2.0 and drive performs Great with Avg. 34MBps on both Read/Write. CNET had reviewed this drive and found this drive performs the best on USB 3.0 with Fastest R/W Speeds. (Read it through Google-ing for it). However on a Laptop, I get Avg. 25MBps on USB 2.0.<br /><br />As, many said USB 3.0 Cable is short but is exact to connect it to Laptop or Desktop's front USB. I don't worry of length, because as of now, I don't have USB 3.0 and hence it is POSSIBLE for me to use all EXISTING MICRO-USB Cables which generally connect my phone to PC. Try using those if you have such drive and have not tried it before (Surprise!)<br /><br />Bit Techy (For Geeks): Drive when plugged recognizes to SCSI Interface and Installs to Normal Portable drive. Drive's hardware identification name is 'Seagate BUP Slim BK USB Device'. Natively Formatted as NTFS and contain propitiatory Seagate Tools and Warranty registration tool. I formatted again and got total space of 1.81TB aka 1907729MB exactly.<br /><br />As if you've read above you'll be felt positive on drive. If I have list negative or disadvantage (with great difficulty),<br />1. Data activity indication LED light a little different (It dims and glows as Non-intrusive instead Quick offs-ons). With Seagate Tools, it is possible to turn off this LED but I wonder why anyone would do this!<br />2. LED is positioned in Top. I prefer it be located near the USB Port like it is done in WD Passport/Essentials, so that activity is visible from side.<br />3. Least one. Pricey compared to Adata, Samsung, WD, etc. Eventually I expect this drive's price will reach near US price in future.<br />4. Heating? Does anyone know HDD that doesn't heatup on working???<br /><br />Verdict is Best buy for ₹ I bought for and Keep going on checkout without any more confusion, as I've already done enough analysis and comparisons for you. (I've done such detailed review like on amazon.com so that people could buy with more clarity of true info and to inspire reader to write such depth reviews on products they buy).<br /><br />Finally for Info, HDD originally manufactured and assembled at China. So, NOT 'MADE IN INDIA' Product :-(<br />-Indian"

Its with new logo in which Seagate changed few months back. The speed is maximum of 86 mb...but mostly it is around 75 mb.. which is little less when compared with transcend and wd elements bcz they both will be around 80- 85 mb mostly. And too the speed reduces to 30 for few seconds.. I dont know why it is like that.The drive is too small than i expected...Registeration of the product is quite easy. A slight disturbance will dusconnect the drive from computer. It is getting heated after usage of 20 minutes.. I think it is common. After registering the warranty is 3 years and 2 months.

I have been using it for a couple of weeks now. The speeds of transfer of data from the USB 3.0 port of my Macbook Air are awesome. Transfers of 1 GB data happen in less than 1 minute. As a lay man user who wants to just back up what ever data he has in his computer in case of emergency, this is a boon. It also comes with a 200 GB cloud with one drive which is free for 2 years. I think thats an added bonus. Also The feature of Lyve app connecting wirelessly to my iPhone, macbook and iPad to back up photos and videos is also a good feature. People who are getting worried about the warranty and product registration, I registered my product on seagate.com and got a genuine 3 year warranty. Here is the snapshot of my warranty.

(For My Passport Ultra) Expensive than elements just because of bundled crappy backup and security software which 99.9% of people don’t use, still if u want u can use free third party advanced softwares available online instead.<br />2. (For Both) 2tb version is extremely thick, heavy and ugly looking, also creates space problem in putting 2-3 pen drives in Hard disk cases like Saco, Neocase etc.<br />3. Hard drive can’t be used as internal drive in pc, because internally usb port is soldered to sata connector.<br />4. Due to above (3rd) reason, in case of broken usb connector with long usage and mishandling, hard drive becomes unusable and data recovery is impossible, because usb connector replacement is impossible, even if hard drive if perfectly fine. (You can google the teardown articles and videos if you want)<br /><br />B:) Seagate expansion 2tb<br />Reasons for rejection:<br />1. I already have it, 1tb version I got as a gift, working superbly, but wanted something new.<br />2. Only 1 year warranty on this model, rest all hard drives have 3 year warranty, so stay away from this drive for now.<br /><br />### NOW WHY SEAGATE BACKUP PLUS SLIM ###<br />Reasons for Selection:<br />1. Slimmest 2TB hard drive in the world.<br />2. Can easily carry in upper shirt pocket.<br />3. Lots of space for other pen drives etc in hard disk cases.(pics attached)<br />4. 3 year warranty.<br />5. Best hard drive according to Thewirecutter.com after extensive testing and review. [...]<br />6. It is most affordable per GB of data and much faster than WD Ultra.<br />7. It contains a Samsung’s (subsidiary of Seagate) M9T model 2tb hard drive, which is just 9.5mm.<br />8. It has a perfectly and easily detachable sata to usb connector inside, so u can use it as a internal drive, not just in your PC but Laptops as well. :)<br />9. It is the only 2tb drive in the world that can be used as a PS4 internal hard drive.(all over the world people are buying backup plus slim just to tear it down to get M9T and fit drive to PS4, u can google as see for urself).<br />10. And due to above reason, in case of any damage to usb connector, it can be easily replaceable or the drive can be used in any usb to sata enclosure or internally as I already told u.<br />11. Speeds are around 125mbps for both Read & Write in CrystalDiskMark.<br />P.S-<br />1. the pics on amazon are little old, as Seagate logo is now changed and Seagate is not written in front now, but on back.<br />2. Even if you are buying 1TB model, all the above points are applicable.<br />3. Comparison pics with last generation Seagate Expansion 1TB also included.<br />4. Product registration takes a minute, go to google and search seagate product registration and open first link and register your product easily and get 3 years warranty.<br />The reason many people facing registration problem is because they are using installed software to register the product, which contain old registration link that doesn't work now, so register on first link found on Google search.

Worked faster and quick to format.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to use the additional 200GB free cloud space for 2 yrs because once I get used to the free 200GB space I will have to either download that entire 200GB cloud to another hard disk and waste money on internet or continue with a yearly subscription. I personally did not like that additional 200GB offer."

I paid almost a 1000 bucks more compared to Paytm deal, but it wasn't there when I bought this, so no regrets. It's so slim, fits within my palm. Silver color is worth the extra 300 bucks, superior finish. Read/write speeds are super high, especially if you have a USB 3.0. Yet to figure out how to setup the 200GB free account with OneDrive. There's a catch here, it's only free for 2 years."

But due to NTFS format it does not work with other(Mac,Linux).<br /><br />Immediately after a week of purchase, the hard disk went bad, I took it to Seagate service centre, they replaced it in 15 days and since then this product seems to work properly...  The service centre guys were friendly and kind of co-operative."
