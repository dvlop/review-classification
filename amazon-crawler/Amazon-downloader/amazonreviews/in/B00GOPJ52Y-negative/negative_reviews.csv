Printer was not able to pool the page so it was useless for printing. Even scaner has non removable stains so it can not scan properly. Then I called technician from HP to solve these issues but he could not solve the problems. Then i applied to return the item and cashback but after two days of schedule dates, no pickup was arranged from amazon. This is very bad experience from amazon. Expecting to resolve the issue as soon as possible."

It printer stores the serial number of the cartridge. And when the ink dries, the printer stores this information. And when you refill the cartridge then this printer will show you that &#34;this cartridge must be replaced&#34;.<br />So, if you have no problem in purchasing a new cartridge every time, then this printer is for you. Instead you can buy a printer having inktank."

I had to literally insert every single page individually while printing. Within a month of its purchase it has now stopped working. It was even a challenge to activate the wireless option. As it cant be returned after 10 days you don't have a choice except to carry the product to the service centre (to my utter disappointment there are just 2 centres in whole of Delhi). In todays busy schedule its really difficult for any one to carry it to service centre for any problem. I am really disappointed with the product as I had great expectations from HP.
