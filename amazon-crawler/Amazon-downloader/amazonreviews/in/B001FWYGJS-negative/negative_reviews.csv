The wireless connectivity suddenly drops and i need to reset the router to connect again. Used to happen every few times a day. I then packed this & started using my 3 year old tiny Beetel work horse. I kept this away packed meaning to get it repaired. In the past few days again I tried this piece & it still dropped wireless connectivity twice in half a day. This is really poor in terms of quality. And the only reason I had bought this was the higher rating on Amazon. Disappointed."

Not enough for even 2 bedroom flat. Not sure if the product design is bad or the instrument is bad, but the purpose of buying 300MBPS with 2 antennas is defeated with this product.

I made the mistake of not reading through the TP-Link forums for this particular product and ended up wasting some time.<br /><br />My Internet connection has a static IP address assigned by my ISP.  I had been using a Belkin router on this connection for the past 5 years, which went bust for some reason a few weeks back.  I ordered this TP-Link router as a replacement.  After adding the connection settings to the router, it connected to the ISP's server within the first 30 seconds.  The connection was smooth initially but after about 2 minutes, the connectivity simply dropped.  I could not resolve any domain name or even ping my ISP's server.<br /><br />After a lot of trial and error I rebooted the router and the connectivity was restored.  The connection remained stable for another 30 seconds and then disappeared again.  Several reboots later I observed that the connection remained stable for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time.  I called up my ISP and asked them to bring their own router along.  The ISP's technician came, configured his own router and the connection worked fine for 30 minutes.  Re-connecting the TP-Link router led us back to the dropped-connections issue.  We re-connected the technician's router and surfed TP-Link forums for posts on this particular router, finding a number of posts from users facing exactly the same issue with all types of connections (not just static IP address) with all firmware versions starting from v6 to the current v10.  No one had been able to resolve the problem other than by installing a custom firmware.<br /><br />Disappointed, I returned the item.  Credit to Amazon for taking the return without asking any questions.  The charged amount was also refunded to me within a week's time.<br /><br />Overall, a very unreliable device and no resolution if one happens to get stuck with a bad piece."
