It has been 6 months and batteries on my mouse are still working and the keyboard batteries would last a year at this rate. I use this kit at my home so they claimed thier limit for office use but yeah that is the battery life i am getting from these in home use<br />I used this kit for playing far cry 4 from the beginning i did ended the game without changing batteries. I play alot of games like Call of duty, Far cry 3, Hitman, prince of persia 4 , Tekken 5 and more, it is quite more than a home user would use his keyboard and mouse.<br />Batteries on these really last long man<br />and they come with alkaline batteries so don't expect the same battery back up with cheap lead batteries.<br />I really bought a 8 pack of duracell for the kit after 3 months i guess but i really didn't get to change the batteries since then"

Best service from Amazon.in","This is my first experience with Amazon.in and It was quite good.<br />I wanted to buy this product so I searched every single website and app like flipkart, snapdeal and paytm. Finally I came on amazon.in<br />Comparing to other sites, the price is very much less.<br /><br />I was told that the product will reach on 8th of june but the product reached 3days before. When I asked the delivery guy that I would like to open the box and check the product before making payment. To my surprise, he politely said okk sir you can, and if anything goes wrong I will accept this product back. I checked the box and everything was in place with appropriate packing.<br /><br />Now comes the best part, Delivery guy had machine So easily I made the payment with my debit card.<br /><br />It's a good product . It's a combo so only one port is being used . Range is good. Only problem is that the keyboard is smaller than your laptop or pc's keyboard.  So initial 2-3 days will be uncomfortable but you will adapt after 3-5 days. It's a logitech product so I don't need to worry at all.<br /><br />Yes I would recommend this product to my friends.<br />Go for it guys."

Function keys can be customized using Logitech SetPoint software.<br />Full sized mouse with invisible optics.<br />Customizable mouse middle button (via SetPoint).<br />No visible LEDs in mouse or keyboard to save battery.<br />High DPI mouse, better that cheaper wired variants.<br />Relatively longer battery life, as compared to other brands.<br />Highly suitable for students, internet users, casual gamers.<br />Saves desktop space.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Mouse battery cover is a little loose. Cover opens up when is used on rough surfaces, like on fabrics or rough denims.<br />Both mouse and keyboard lacks on/off switch. Battery is to be removed to turn off mouse or keyboard.<br />No status indicator LEDs on keyboard. SetPoint software is to be installed for OSD and battery level indication.<br />The keys at the edges (function keys and arrow keys) are too crammed.<br />Not suitable for heavy use or hard-core gaming."

Although, that compactness comes with a price you have to pay with an unconventional keyboard layout that isn't exactly so comfortable. But I have already got accustomed to it now, so I can use it without any issues.<br /><br />The key travel seems to have placed somewhere between that of a laptop keyboard and a conventional full-size keyboard. Hence it gives commendable feedback, and is extremely comfortable.<br /><br />But I find the mouse uncomfortable to use. It isn't grippy and isn't that ergonomic. Besides, the scroll wheel button feels too hard.<br />Instead, I have been using the Logitech M185 for the past 6 years, which is undoubtedly one of the best budget wireless mice by logitech.<br /><br />Do check out my full video review here:<br />(...)"

The parcel came in extra large pack which can held more then 5 such keyboards. Amazon should think of the wastage it is doing.<br /><br />I bought this keyboard and mouse to be used with my laptop. so form factor is just perfect. Works well. It reminds me of an old advertisement of a bike - complementing its fuel efficiency&#34; fill it, shut it and forget it&#34; same can be told about this product. Plug the dongle and forget it. keyboard and mouse work very nice.<br /><br />Reason for not giving 5 star is as its a wireless keyboard we have to pick it up many a times. Have a close look at the form. there is no extra space on top, right or bottom. So whenever you pick it up from these side few of keys gets pressed which is very annoying. but now I pick it by holding from left side only.<br /><br />If this is not a problem for you I would suggest go and buy this product."

If you know typing, another issue is that the letter F and J is not having a small projection which guide your fingers (I'm not sure of this at the moment, will correct if othwise)<br /><br />I'm using this product for about a month and it's quite OK, saves space of your desk..

After a lot of searching I finally zeroed on this keyboard mouse combo, firstly because of it'sperfect dimensions (best suited for persons using laptops and wanna carry a wireless keyboard on the go in their backpack) and secondly the most obvious reason that it is of Logitech.<br />I would like to add something here because I think this is something many of you don't know or may not have noticed like me. Logitech International is actually a Swiss Multinational company and not of Taiwan or South Korea as the name may sound like.<br />Build Quality:<br />The build quality is nice especially the keyboard.But I would have preferred a better build of the mouse. The top piece of the mouse doesn't sit firmly and is a little squeaky. You can find this really clearly when you hold the mouse up in air and shake it gently. Even some low cost mouse vendors like Zebronics, iball provide better build mouse than this. The keyboard is well built, not squeky of any sorts but certainly not spill proof. To tell you about the overall size of the keyboard I would tell that is almost the same as the size of a laptop (ie. of a 14-15.6 inch) keypad. I hope you can understand how compact it is.<br />Usability:The keyboard has closely placed keys which might be annoying for some but if you are used to using laptops it won't be an issue. There is also a INR symbol in this keyboard and thats really handy. I must mention that this keyboard has every keys that are present on a normal desktop keyboard even the print screen key(which comes in handy while test ping) inspite of its compact form factor. The keys are quite tactile too. Moreover the keyboard comes with multimedia functionality with all shortcut keys of volume up down, calculator, my computer and so on. You need to press the FN key plus the respective keys (i.e for those multimedia functionality) together. Overall the mouse response is really good. And kudos to the strong range of the wifi you can use this keyboard sitting far away from the computer. Best suited for watching movie and sitting on your bed or sofa while your computer is placed about 10ft away on the table. No issues. Or maybe for slide presentation.<br />Inbox contents:<br />1. Mouse 2. Keyboard 3.Two AAA GP Alkaline battery (mouse) 4.Two AA GP Alkaline Battery.<br />Competitors:<br />1.Microsoft Wireless Desktop Keyboard 800<br />2.Dell Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo KM113<br />But considering the form factor of the Logitech MK220 there at all no competition because the other two are much bigger in size and difficult to carry round. Plus I suggest to go with Logitech as it's a more experienced player in the field of computer accessories than the other two.<br />If you like my review kindly press the like button below to support me to write more reviews like this in future."

Beware of playing any shooter games, you may end up shooting your own guys accidently. trying to find a way how to get this replaced/repaired/resolved. can amazon help.?"

After using for 3 months, here are the reviews.<br /><br />Pros :<br />- Excellent connectivity for my laptop and desktop (works excellent in Debian Linux).<br />- Small and compact keyboard which was uncomfortable during the first 1-2weeks of use but after getting used to the keys, the experience is amazing.<br />- Keys are super quiet and smooth<br /><br />Cons -<br />- Mouse is a bit heavy because of AA batteries. Would be much better if AAA batteries are used.<br />- USB receiver is a bit bulky.<br /><br />I have been using this Keyboard & Mouse combo for 3 months now for Software Development work and the experience is excellent. If you plan to buy this, just go for it without any 2nd thoughts."

Arrow keys are not good for gaming.","Hi i bought this keyboard more than a year back, to use with my nexus 2012. It was fine, laptop style, small size yet usable. As i already had a wired keyboard for desktop, i used it only when there is no power, with tablet for net browsing and typing emails.<br /><br />2 Problems i faced:<br />1. Because of small size arrow/navigation keys, it is difficult to play games or scroll webpages.<br />2. As i was busy, i didn't use the keyboad for around 1.5 to 2 months. I forgot about the free batteries inside. They leaked and as circute is right below the batteries, entire circute got damaged. Now i am left with a brand new shell of the keyboard.<br /><br />So my advice to all of you is... Buy a good set of batteries and never ever leave them inside when not in use."

But as I continued using them I feel the weight more of a convenience because the mouse sits stable on the pad due to its weight.<br />Both the keyboard and mouse are responsive and I hardly feel any lag or delay in their operations.<br />I would highly recommend anybody to go for this, of course, based on my initial experience."

The box includes batteries for the mouse and the keyboard, which is a plus. The keyboard is quite compact, yet includes full-sized keys."

"55","XX","","4","0","0","on 30 January 2016","ANONYMOUS","A good combination, at a great price.","The delivery was prompt, and the product was in pristine condition. It's just as we see in the listing, and works as expected too. There are no connectivity hassles, just plug and play.<br /><br />It's great for the price and I'm pretty happy with the product overall, but it does have its limitations and cons.<br /><br />For example, the keyboard, in its quest to be compact, is a little too compact and ends up being difficult to hold from most angles. Also, the mouse is on the coarse side (speaking sensitivity wise), coz it's a bit low on the sensor resolution probably to keep the price down."

I would not recommend for any other use, definitely not for regular work.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plug and play, works out of the box. (Tried in XP and Windows 7)<br />It has good range.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not very sturdy, feels like some keys might fall off.<br />Keyboard layout is crammed and not at all ergonomic, especially the arrow keys.<br />No power button, hopefully the power is managed well by the electronics."

It works good and has a good range of input functionality. The only thing i found lacking is the On/Off switch for saving upon the battery. The frequency finder (I suppose) may latch continuously for the receiver which may consume the battery and you have to change it frequently. Though the product works fine and does its function properly.<br /><br />A must buy for avoiding the wires and do the lazy bed time surfing. ;)"

Excellent product, very useful, The office table is now with lot of free space, no wires and gives lot of freedom to keep the keyboard away when not in use. another use i found is the security to the computer. if we remove the  wireless connector, the computer cant be used as the keyboard and mouse are not connected.<br />to add the service of amazon was excellent. safe packing and quick delivery.  I recommend this wireless keyboard and mouse."
