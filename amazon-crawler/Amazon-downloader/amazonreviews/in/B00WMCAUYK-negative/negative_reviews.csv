I did a big big mistake by ordering it from amazon it seems. It doesn't work at all. I had a memory card worth 8 gb and wanted to upgrade to 32GB. Transferring the data to the new card took me some time, however now that I am wanting to return the useless card it's showing me the return policy. I was a great fan of amazon and used to recommend every one to shop from amazon however after this horrible experience I am dead sure not to buy anything fro you. First and foremost you'll have sold a faulty product (am sure you must have got reviews just like mine for this product ) on top if that the return policy doesn't allow customer to return the defective piece. Need less to say your business has grown in india market. and you'll are loosing loyal customers. The business may grow for few months however it will not continue for sure."
