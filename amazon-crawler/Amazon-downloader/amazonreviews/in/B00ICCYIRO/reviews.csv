Following is what I think about it -<br /><br />- Its does not leak air while pumping which is great, since many pumps have this problem otherwise (I mean the whole where air is sucked from).<br />- Its quite small but effective, so u can carry it if u have deep pockets or a small handbag.<br />- One think which I did not like is that only 1 needle fits perfectly, other leaks air as its loose."
